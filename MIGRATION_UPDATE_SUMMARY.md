# Migration Restructuring Update Summary

## Files Updated Due to Migration Directory Restructuring

Following the migration cleanup and reorganization, several files needed updates to properly handle the new directory structure where active migrations are in the main directory and examples/rollbacks are in subdirectories.

### 1. Migration Runner Scripts Updated ✅

**`tripsage/db/migrations/runner.py`**
- **Updated**: `get_migration_files()` method (lines 105-118)
- **Change**: Added filtering to only scan files directly in migrations directory, excluding subdirectories
- **Reason**: Prevents processing of example queries and rollback files as active migrations
- **Added Logic**:
  ```python
  # Only get SQL files directly in the migrations directory (not in subdirectories)
  migration_files = sorted([
      f for f in MIGRATIONS_DIR.glob("*.sql")
      if (f.is_file() and 
          re.match(r"\d{8}_\d{2}_.*\.sql", f.name) and
          f.parent == MIGRATIONS_DIR)  # Ensure file is directly in migrations dir
  ])
  ```

**`migrations/mcp_migration_runner.py`**
- **Updated**: `run_pending_migrations()` method (lines 248-270)
- **Change**: Added filtering to exclude subdirectories and enhanced rollback detection
- **Reason**: Ensures only active migration files are processed, not examples or rollbacks
- **Added Logic**:
  ```python
  # Filter to only include files directly in migrations directory (not subdirectories) 
  for f in all_files:
      file_path = os.path.join(self.migrations_dir, f)
      if (os.path.isfile(file_path) and 
          "rollback" not in f.lower() and
          re.match(r"\d{8}_\d{2}_.*\.sql", f)):
          migration_files.append(f)
  ```

### 2. Documentation Updated ✅

**`migrations/README.md`**
- **Updated**: Section on creating new migrations (line 97)
- **Change**: Updated reference from `20250508_06_rollback.sql` to `rollbacks/` directory
- **Updated**: Import path example (line 84)
- **Change**: Corrected import from `src.db.migrations` to `tripsage.db.migrations`

### 3. Files That DON'T Need Updates ✅

The following files were checked and confirmed to NOT need updates:

- **API endpoints**: No hardcoded migration file references found
- **Configuration files**: No migration directory path dependencies  
- **Service layer**: No direct migration file dependencies
- **Test files**: No migration-specific path references

### 4. Key Benefits of Updates

1. **Proper Separation**: Migration runners now correctly ignore example and rollback files
2. **Maintained Functionality**: All existing migration functionality preserved
3. **Future-Proof**: New directory structure properly supported
4. **Documentation Accuracy**: README now reflects actual file structure

### 5. Testing Recommendations

Before deployment, test:
1. **Migration discovery**: Verify only active migrations are found
2. **Dry run functionality**: Ensure dry runs work correctly with new structure
3. **Rollback access**: Confirm rollback files can still be accessed when needed manually
4. **Example accessibility**: Verify example files are available for reference

### 6. No Breaking Changes

- All existing migration functionality is preserved
- Migration execution order remains unchanged
- API compatibility maintained
- No database schema changes required

The restructuring is now complete and fully supported by the application infrastructure.
