# Archived Documentation

This directory contains historical documentation that is no longer relevant to the current TripSage AI architecture.

## Contents

- **legacy_architecture/**: Old dual storage and knowledge graph implementations (deprecated)
- **migration_planning/**: Historical API consolidation and migration plans (completed)
- **prompting_guides/**: Outdated GPT-4.1 prompting guides (replaced by newer models)

## Why Archived?

These documents were moved out of the main documentation tree to:
- Reduce repository size and complexity
- Avoid confusion with current architecture
- Preserve historical context without cluttering active docs

## Note

If you need to reference these documents for historical context, they are preserved here.
For current architecture and implementation details, see the main `/docs` directory.
