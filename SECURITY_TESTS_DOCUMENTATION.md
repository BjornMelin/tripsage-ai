- **Coverage Focus**: Attachment and activity security fixes

#### Security Fixes Tested:

**Line 376 Fix - Attachment Trip Access Verification:**

- User isolation across activities
- Trip-based activity access control

#### Key Security Features Tested:
- **Trip access verification** - All attachment operations verify trip access first
- **User data isolation** - Users cannot access attachments from unauthorized trips
- **Cross-user access prevention** - Preventing access to other users' data
- **Permission-based access** - Collaborator permissions for attachments
- **Security audit logging** - Unauthorized access attempts logged
- **Error handling** - Security errors properly handled and HTTP status codes
- **Cross-trip access prevention** - URL manipulation protection
- **Attachment isolation** - Proper isolation between users and trips

## Test Patterns and Best Practices

### 1. Fixture Usage
- **mock_principal**: Standard authenticated user
- **mock_unauthorized_principal**: Different user for unauthorized access tests
- **mock_trip_service**: Mocked trip service with configurable responses
- **mock_audit_service**: Mocked audit logging for security event verification
- **sample_trip_data**: Consistent trip data across tests

### 2. Security Test Patterns
- **Positive authorization tests**: Verify authorized users can access resources
- **Negative authorization tests**: Verify unauthorized users are denied access
- **Permission hierarchy tests**: Verify different permission levels work correctly
- **Audit logging verification**: Ensure security events are properly logged
- **Error handling tests**: Verify proper error responses and status codes
- **Edge case testing**: Handle malformed requests and boundary conditions

### 3. Parametrized Testing
- Multiple permission levels tested with single test method
- Different endpoint access patterns verified systematically
- Various security scenarios covered comprehensively

### 4. Mock Strategy
- **AsyncMock** for asynchronous service methods
- **Mock** for synchronous objects and responses
- **patch** for isolating external dependencies (audit logging)
- Configurable mock responses for different test scenarios

## Security Coverage Metrics

### Areas Covered (90%+ expected coverage):
1. **Authentication verification** - All endpoints require valid principals
2. **Authorization enforcement** - Trip access checks before operations
3. **Permission hierarchy** - View < Edit < Manage permission levels
4. **Audit logging** - Security events logged for monitoring
5. **Error handling** - Proper HTTP status codes and error messages
6. **Data isolation** - Users only access their authorized data
7. **Cross-trip protection** - URL manipulation prevention
8. **Collaboration security** - Proper collaborator permission enforcement

### Security Scenarios Tested:
- ✅ Trip owner access
- ✅ Collaborator access with various permission levels
- ✅ Unauthorized user access denial
- ✅ Cross-user data isolation
- ✅ Cross-trip access prevention
- ✅ Permission hierarchy enforcement
- ✅ Public trip access patterns
- ✅ Security audit logging
- ✅ Error handling and status codes
- ✅ Malformed request handling

```

## Integration with CI/CD

### Security Test Requirements
- All security tests must pass before deployment
- 90%+ coverage required for security-related code
- No security vulnerabilities in static analysis
- Audit logging verification in all tests

- Test files: `test_*_security.py`
- Test classes: `Test<FeatureName>Security`
- Test methods: `test_<scenario>_<expected_outcome>`

## Maintenance and Updates

### When to Update Tests
1. **New security features** - Add corresponding security tests
2. **Permission model changes** - Update permission hierarchy tests
3. **New endpoints** - Add security tests for new routes
4. **Security policy changes** - Update tests to match new policies

### Test Quality Checklist
