## Redis/DragonflyDB Connection Issues (Fixed)

### Problem
Backend tests were failing with:
```
ConnectionError: Error 111 connecting to localhost:6379. Connect call failed ('127.0.0.1', 6379)
```

### Root Cause
1. DragonflyDB Docker container was stopped
2. Test environment was using incorrect password configuration

### Solution

1. **Start DragonflyDB container if not running:**
```bash
# Check if container exists
docker ps -a | grep dragonfly

# Start existing container
docker start tripsage-dragonfly

# Or create new container if needed
docker run -d --name tripsage-dragonfly -p 6379:6379 \
  docker.dragonflydb.io/dragonflydb/dragonfly:latest \
  --logtostderr --cache_mode --requirepass tripsage_secure_password
```

2. **Fix test environment password mismatch:**
The test environment file (`tests/.env.test`) had a different password than what DragonflyDB was configured with.

Updated `tests/.env.test`:
```env
# DragonflyDB Configuration (Test Values)
DRAGONFLY_URL=redis://localhost:6379/15
DRAGONFLY_PASSWORD=tripsage_secure_password  # Changed from test_dragonfly_password
```

3. **Verify connection:**
```bash
uv run python scripts/verification/verify_dragonfly.py
```

### Current Status
- DragonflyDB is running and accessible
- Authentication is working correctly
- Memory system integration tests now connect successfully
- Tests are failing due to missing API endpoints (404 errors), not Redis connection issues

### Additional Issues Found
1. Memory API endpoints (`/api/memory/*`) are not implemented in the router
2. Some cache service methods have signature mismatches (e.g., `set()` method expects different parameters)
3. Event loop closure warnings in async tests need investigation

### Next Steps
- Implement missing memory API endpoints
- Fix cache service method signatures
- Investigate async test lifecycle issues
