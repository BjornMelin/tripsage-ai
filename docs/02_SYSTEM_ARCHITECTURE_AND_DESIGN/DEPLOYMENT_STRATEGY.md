# TripSage Deployment and CI/CD Strategy

This document outlines the comprehensive deployment and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) strategy for the TripSage travel planning system. The strategy details how TripSage's microservice architecture will be containerized, deployed, and maintained across various environments.

## 1. Architectural Overview

### 1.1 Microservices Architecture

TripSage implements a microservices architecture with the following key components:

- **Frontend**: A Next.js application serving the user interface.
- **Backend API**: A FastAPI service handling core business logic, user authentication, and orchestration of MCP server calls.
- **MCP Servers**: Specialized microservices, each dedicated to a specific domain or external API integration. Examples include:
  - Memory MCP Server (Neo4j-based knowledge graph)
  - Google Maps MCP Server (location services)
  - Flights MCP Server (flight search and booking via Duffel API)
  - Accommodations MCP Server (Airbnb via OpenBnB, Booking.com via Apify)
  - Time MCP Server (timezone management)
  - Weather MCP Server (weather forecasting)
  - WebCrawl MCP Server (web data extraction via Crawl4AI, Firecrawl)
  - Browser Automation Tools (interacting with Playwright/Stagehand MCPs)
  - Calendar MCP Server (Google Calendar integration)
- **Databases**:
  - **Supabase (PostgreSQL)**: Primary relational database for structured data (production).
  - **Neon (PostgreSQL)**: Relational database for development and testing environments, leveraging branching.
  - **Neo4j**: Knowledge graph database for semantic data and relationships (via Memory MCP).
  - **Redis**: Distributed cache for API responses, search results, and session data.

### 1.2 Infrastructure Components

The deployment infrastructure includes:

- **Containerization**: Docker for packaging all backend services and MCP servers.
- **Container Registry**: GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) for storing Docker images.
- **Orchestration**:
  - Kubernetes for production and staging environments.
  - Docker Compose for local development environments.
- **Hosting**:
  - Vercel for the Next.js frontend, leveraging its Git integration and Edge Network.
  - Managed Kubernetes service (e.g., GKE, EKS, AKS) for backend APIs and MCP servers.
- **Database Hosting**:
  - Managed Supabase instance for production.
  - Managed Neon instances for development.
  - Managed Neo4j (e.g., AuraDB) or self-hosted Neo4j for the knowledge graph.
- **Caching**: Managed Redis service.
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Datadog (or similar like Prometheus/Grafana) for application performance monitoring, logging, and alerting.
- **CDN**: Vercel Edge Network for frontend assets; potentially another CDN for API caching if needed.

## 2. Environments

TripSage utilizes standard environments for its development lifecycle:

### 2.1 Development (Local)

- **Purpose**: Individual developer environments for feature development and unit testing.
- **Infrastructure**: Local Docker Compose to run backend services, MCPs, and databases (local Supabase/Neon instances, local Neo4j, local Redis).
- **Database**: Local Supabase/Neon instances, often using Neon's branching for isolated feature development.
- **Deployment**: Manual, via `docker-compose up`.
- **Branch Strategy**: Feature branches (`feature/name-of-feature`).

### 2.2 Staging

- **Purpose**: Integration testing, pre-production validation, and QA.
- **Infrastructure**: Dedicated Kubernetes cluster (or a staging namespace within a shared cluster).
- **Database**: Dedicated staging Supabase instance, staging Neo4j instance, staging Redis instance.
- **Deployment**: Automated via CI/CD pipeline upon merges to the `main` or `develop` branch.
- **Branch Strategy**: `main` or `develop` branch.

### 2.3 Production

- **Purpose**: Live, user-facing environment.
- **Infrastructure**: Production-grade Kubernetes cluster with high availability, auto-scaling, and robust monitoring.
- **Database**: Production Supabase instance, production Neo4j instance, production Redis instance, all with backups and disaster recovery plans.
- **Deployment**: Automated via CI/CD pipeline from release branches or tags, typically requiring manual approval for promotion to production.
- **Branch Strategy**: Release branches (`release/v1.x.x`) or tags (`v1.x.x`).

## 3. Containerization Strategy

### 3.1 Docker Implementation

Each backend component (FastAPI, MCP servers) is containerized using Docker.

Example Dockerfile for a FastAPI backend service:

```dockerfile
# Example Dockerfile for FastAPI backend
FROM python:3.11-slim as base

WORKDIR /app

# Install poetry (or your chosen package manager like uv)
# RUN pip install poetry
# COPY poetry.lock pyproject.toml ./
# RUN poetry install --no-dev

# Using requirements.txt with uv
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN uv pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy application code
COPY src/ ./src/

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 8000

# Run with gunicorn for production
CMD ["gunicorn", "src.api.main:app", "--workers", "4", "--worker-class", "uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8000"]
```

### 3.2 Multi-Stage Builds

For optimized container images, multi-stage builds are used, especially for compiled languages or when build tools are not needed in the final image. For Python, this is less critical but can be used to separate build dependencies from runtime dependencies.

Example multi-stage build for a Next.js frontend (managed by Vercel, but illustrative):

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build dependencies
FROM node:18-alpine AS deps
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci

# Stage 2: Build the application
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Stage 3: Production image
FROM node:18-alpine AS runner
WORKDIR /app
ENV NODE_ENV production

COPY --from=builder /app/next.config.js ./
COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public
COPY --from=builder /app/.next ./.next
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=builder /app/package.json ./package.json

EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### 3.3 Container Security

- **Non-root Users**: Run applications inside containers as non-root users.
- **Minimal Base Images**: Use slim base images (e.g., `python:3.11-slim-bullseye`).
- **Security Scanning**: Integrate image scanning tools (e.g., Trivy, Snyk) into the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Immutable Image Tags**: Use SHA digests or specific version tags for deployments rather than `latest`.
- **Regular Updates**: Periodically update base images and dependencies to patch vulnerabilities.

## 4. CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

### 4.1 GitHub Actions Workflow

TripSage uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation.

Key jobs in the pipeline:

1. **Lint & Test**: Runs on every push to feature branches and pull requests to `main`/`develop`.
   - Checkout code.
   - Set up Python/Node.js.
   - Install dependencies.
   - Run linters (e.g., Ruff, ESLint).
   - Run unit and integration tests (e.g., Pytest, Vitest).
   - (Optional) Build Docker images for testing purposes.
2. **Build & Push**: Runs on pushes to `main`/`develop` (for staging) and tags/release branches (for production).
   - Checkout code.
   - Set up Docker Buildx.
   - Login to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).
   - Extract metadata (tags, labels).
   - Build Docker images for each service.
   - Push images to GHCR.
   - (Optional) Run container security scans.
3. **Deploy to Staging**: Runs after successful Build & Push on `main`/`develop`.
   - Set up `kubectl`.
   - Configure Kubernetes context for the staging cluster (using secrets).
   - Update Kubernetes deployments with the new image tags.
   - Verify deployment rollout status.
   - Run post-deployment smoke tests.
4. **Deploy to Production**: Runs after successful Build & Push on tags/release branches, often with manual approval.
   - Similar steps to Deploy to Staging, but targets the production Kubernetes cluster and namespace.
   - May involve more sophisticated deployment strategies (Blue/Green, Canary).

          # Repeat for other services
          kubectl rollout status deployment/tripsage-backend-api -n production --timeout=300s
```

### 4.2 Vercel Deployment (Frontend)

The Next.js frontend is deployed using Vercel's native Git integration.

- Connect the GitHub repository to a Vercel project.
- Vercel automatically builds and deploys on pushes to specified branches (e.g., `main` for production, feature branches for previews).
- Environment variables are configured in the Vercel project settings.

`vercel.json` (example):

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json", // Or next.config.js, or specific entry point
      "use": "@vercel/next"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [{ "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/$1" }],
  "env": {
    "NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL": "https://api.tripsage.app", // Example production API URL
    "NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL": "https://your-project.supabase.co",
    "NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY": "your-anon-key"
  },
  "github": {
    "enabled": true, // Enable GitHub integration features
    "silent": false // Post deployment status comments on PRs
  }
}
```

## 5. Deployment Strategies (Backend Services)

### 5.1 Blue/Green Deployments

For zero-downtime deployments of backend services in Kubernetes:

1. **New Version Deployment (Green)**: Deploy the new version of the application alongside the existing version (Blue) in the same namespace but with a different label (e.g., `version: green`).
2. **Testing**: Run automated tests against the Green deployment's internal service endpoint.
3. **Traffic Switching**: Update the main Kubernetes Service selector to point to the Green deployment's pods (e.g., `selector: app: tripsage-api, version: green`). This instantly switches all traffic.
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor the Green deployment for issues.
5. **Rollback**: If issues arise, switch the Service selector back to the Blue deployment.
6. **Decommission Blue**: Once Green is stable, scale down and remove the Blue deployment.

This can be managed with Kubernetes manifest changes or tools like Argo Rollouts.

### 5.2 Canary Deployments

For riskier changes, or to gradually roll out features:

1. **Limited Deployment**: Deploy the new version (Canary) to a small subset of pods (e.g., 5-10% of replicas).
2. **Traffic Splitting**: Use a service mesh (like Istio or Linkerd) or an Ingress controller that supports weighted traffic splitting to route a small percentage of user traffic to the Canary version.
3. **Monitoring**: Closely monitor performance metrics, error rates, and user feedback for the Canary deployment.
4. **Gradual Rollout**: If the Canary is stable, gradually increase the traffic percentage.
5. **Full Rollout/Rollback**: If all metrics are satisfactory, roll out to 100%. If issues are detected, roll back traffic to the stable version.

Example Istio `VirtualService` for canary:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3 # Or v1beta1, v1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: tripsage-backend-api
spec:
  hosts:
    - api.tripsage.app # External hostname
  http:
    - route:
        - destination:
            host: tripsage-backend-api-stable # K8s service for stable version
            subset: v1
          weight: 90
        - destination:
            host: tripsage-backend-api-canary # K8s service for canary version
            subset: v2
          weight: 10
```

### 5.3 Feature Flags

For decoupling feature releases from deployments:

- Use a feature flag system (e.g., LaunchDarkly, Unleash, or a custom solution).
- Wrap new features in code with feature flag checks.
- Deploy code with features disabled.
- Enable features for specific users, percentages of users, or globally via the feature flag management UI without requiring a new deployment.

Example in Python:

```python
# Example feature flag implementation
import os

def is_feature_enabled(feature_name: str, user_id: Optional[str] = None) -> bool:
    """Checks if a feature is enabled.
    In a real system, this would call a feature flag service.
    """
    # Simple environment variable based example
    if os.getenv(f"FEATURE_{feature_name.upper()}", "false").lower() == "true":
        return True
    # Add more sophisticated logic, e.g., user-specific flags
    return False

# Usage
if is_feature_enabled("NEW_SEARCH_ALGORITHM", user_id=current_user.id):
    # Use new search
    pass
else:
    # Use old search
    pass
```

## 6. Kubernetes Configuration (Backend Services)

### 6.1 Resource Management

Define resource requests and limits for all services in Kubernetes Deployments.

```yaml
# Example Kubernetes Deployment snippet with resource management
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: tripsage-backend-api
  namespace: production
spec:
  replicas: 3
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: backend-api
          image: ghcr.io/your-org/tripsage-backend-api:v1.0.0
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8000
          resources:
            requests: # Guaranteed resources
              memory: "256Mi"
              cpu: "250m" # 0.25 CPU core
            limits: # Maximum resources
              memory: "512Mi"
              cpu: "500m" # 0.5 CPU core
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /health # Assuming a /health endpoint
              port: 8000
            initialDelaySeconds: 30
            periodSeconds: 10
          readinessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /health
              port: 8000
            initialDelaySeconds: 5
            periodSeconds: 5
```

### 6.2 Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)

Implement HPA based on CPU and/or memory utilization, or custom metrics.

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2 # Use v2 for more metric types
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: tripsage-backend-api-hpa
  namespace: production
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: tripsage-backend-api
  minReplicas: 3
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
    - type: Resource
      resource:
        name: cpu
        target:
          type: Utilization
          averageUtilization: 75 # Target 75% CPU utilization
    - type: Resource
      resource:
        name: memory
        target:
          type: Utilization
          averageUtilization: 80 # Target 80% Memory utilization
```

### 6.3 ConfigMaps and Secrets

- **ConfigMaps**: Store non-sensitive configuration data (e.g., log levels, default settings, feature flags if managed internally).
- **Secrets**: Store sensitive data (e.g., API keys, database passwords, JWT secrets). Ensure these are base64 encoded when creating the Secret manifest. Use tools like HashiCorp Vault or Sealed Secrets for more secure secret management in production.

Example ConfigMap:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: tripsage-backend-config
  namespace: production
data:
  LOG_LEVEL: "INFO"
  DEFAULT_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS: "3600"
  API_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE: "100"
```

These values are then mounted as environment variables or files into the pods.

## 7. Database Deployment and Migration

### 7.1 Supabase/Neon Configuration

- Separate Supabase projects for Staging and Production.
- Neon for development, utilizing its branching feature for isolated development databases.
- Connection details (URL, keys) are managed as secrets and injected into application pods as environment variables.

### 7.2 Migration Strategy

- Database migrations are version-controlled in the `/migrations` directory (e.g., `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_description.sql`).
- **Development**: Developers apply migrations to their Neon branches manually or using a local migration tool.
- **Staging/Production**: Migrations are applied automatically as part of the CI/CD pipeline _before_ the new application version is deployed. This can be done using a Kubernetes Job that runs the migration tool (e.g., Supabase CLI, Flyway, Alembic) against the target database.
- Rollback scripts should be prepared for each migration where feasible.

Example migration script (`migrations/20250516100000_add_trip_status.sql`):

```sql
-- Add status column to trips table
ALTER TABLE trips ADD COLUMN status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'planning';

COMMENT ON COLUMN trips.status IS 'Current status of the trip (e.g., planning, booked, completed, cancelled)';

-- Update existing trips to have a default status
UPDATE trips SET status = 'planning' WHERE status IS NULL;

-- Add a check constraint for status values
ALTER TABLE trips ADD CONSTRAINT trips_status_check CHECK (status IN ('planning', 'booked', 'completed', 'cancelled'));

-- Down migration (for rollback)
-- ALTER TABLE trips DROP CONSTRAINT trips_status_check;
-- ALTER TABLE trips DROP COLUMN status;
```

## 8. Monitoring and Observability

### 8.1 Logging Strategy

- **Structured Logging**: All services output logs in a structured format (e.g., JSON).
  Example Python structured logging:

  ```python
  import logging
  import json
  from datetime import datetime

  class JsonFormatter(logging.Formatter):
      def format(self, record):
          log_record = {
              "timestamp": datetime.utcfromtimestamp(record.created).isoformat() + "Z",
              "level": record.levelname,
              "message": record.getMessage(),
              "logger_name": record.name,
              "module": record.module,
              "funcName": record.funcName,
              "lineno": record.lineno,
          }
          if hasattr(record, 'props'): # For custom properties
              log_record.update(record.props)
          return json.dumps(log_record)

  # Configure logger
  logger = logging.getLogger("tripsage-backend")
  logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
  handler = logging.StreamHandler()
  handler.setFormatter(JsonFormatter())
  logger.addHandler(handler)

  # Usage
  logger.info("User login successful", extra={'props': {'user_id': '123'}})
  ```

- **Log Aggregation**: Use a log aggregation tool (e.g., Datadog Logs, ELK Stack, Loki) to collect logs from all services.
- **Correlation IDs**: Include a correlation ID in logs to trace requests across multiple services.

### 8.2 Metrics Collection

- **Application Metrics**: Expose key metrics from services using a Prometheus-compatible endpoint (e.g., `/metrics`).
  - Request rate, error rate, latency (RED metrics).
  - Queue lengths, processing times.
  - Cache hit/miss rates.
  - Business-specific metrics (e.g., number of trips planned, searches performed).
- **Infrastructure Metrics**: Monitor CPU, memory, disk, and network usage of Kubernetes nodes and pods.
- **Database Metrics**: Monitor database performance, connection counts, query latency.

### 8.3 Dashboards and Alerts

- **Dashboards**: Create dashboards in Datadog (or Grafana) to visualize key metrics for:
  - Overall system health.
  - Performance of individual services.
  - Business KPIs.
- **Alerts**: Configure alerts for:
  - High error rates.
  - Increased latency.
  - Resource saturation (CPU, memory, disk).
  - Service unavailability.
  - SLA violations.

## 9. Disaster Recovery

### 9.1 Backup Strategy

- **Databases (Supabase/Neon, Neo4j, Redis)**:
  - Utilize managed backup features provided by Supabase, Neon, and AuraDB (if used).
  - For self-hosted Neo4j/Redis, implement regular automated backups (e.g., daily snapshots) with off-site storage.
  - Define backup retention policies.
- **Configurations**: Kubernetes manifests, Docker images, and CI/CD pipeline configurations are version-controlled in Git.
- **Container Images**: Stored in GHCR with versioning.

### 9.2 Recovery Plans

- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: Maximum acceptable downtime (e.g., 1 hour for production).
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: Maximum acceptable data loss (e.g., 15 minutes for production database).
- Document recovery procedures for each critical component.
- Regularly test disaster recovery procedures.

### 9.3 Failover Procedures

- **Database Failover**: Utilize high-availability configurations of managed database services. For self-hosted, set up replication and automated failover.
- **Service Instance Failures**: Kubernetes handles pod restarts and rescheduling.
- **Region/Zone Outages**: Design for multi-zone or multi-region deployments for critical components if required by SLAs. This involves replicating data and having failover mechanisms for traffic routing.

## 10. Security Considerations

### 10.1 Network Security

- **Private Kubernetes Cluster**: Where possible, use private networking for the Kubernetes cluster.
- **Network Policies**: Implement Kubernetes NetworkPolicies to restrict pod-to-pod communication to only what is necessary.
- **Service Mesh (Optional but Recommended)**: Use Istio or Linkerd for mTLS (mutual TLS) encrypted service-to-service communication, traffic management, and observability.
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: Place a WAF in front of public-facing endpoints (API Gateway, Frontend) to protect against common web exploits.

### 10.2 Secret Management

- **Kubernetes Secrets**: Use for injecting sensitive configuration (API keys, passwords) into pods.
- **External Secret Management (Recommended for Production)**: Integrate with tools like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Google Secret Manager for more robust secret storage, rotation, and access control.
- **No Secrets in Code/Images**: Ensure no sensitive data is hardcoded or included in container images.
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Service accounts and application roles should only have the permissions necessary to perform their tasks.

### 10.3 Compliance and Auditing

- **Audit Logging**: Implement audit logging for critical actions (e.g., administrative changes, data access, login attempts).
- **Data Protection**: Ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) if handling user data.
- **Regular Security Scans**:
  - Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST).
  - Container image vulnerability scanning.
  - Dependency vulnerability scanning.
- **Penetration Testing**: Schedule periodic penetration tests by third-party security experts.

## 11. Deployment Checklist

A pre-deployment checklist to ensure readiness:

- [ ] Code has been reviewed and approved.
- [ ] Security scans (SAST, DAST, image, dependency) completed with no critical vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Documentation (API docs, release notes) updated.
- [ ] Database migrations tested and rollback plan verified.
- [ ] Kubernetes resource requests and limits reviewed and set appropriately.
- [ ] Configuration for the target environment (ConfigMaps, Secrets) verified.
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards and alerts updated/configured for the new version.
- [ ] Rollback plan documented and understood by the deployment team.
- [ ] On-call schedule confirmed and team notified of deployment.
- [ ] Communication plan for users/stakeholders (if applicable).

## 12. Implementation Timeline (Phased Approach)

The deployment infrastructure itself will be implemented in phases:

### Phase 1: Foundation (Month 1 of Infrastructure Setup)

- Set up basic CI/CD pipelines (lint, test, build Docker images).
- Configure containerization for all services.
- Deploy a staging environment (e.g., using Docker Compose locally or a simple K8s setup).
- Implement basic monitoring and logging.

### Phase 2: Production Readiness (Month 2)

- Set up the production Kubernetes environment.
- Implement robust CI/CD for staging and production deployments.
- Configure Horizontal Pod Autoscaling.
- Establish database backup and recovery procedures.
- Implement Blue/Green or Canary deployment strategy for key services.

### Phase 3: Optimization & Hardening (Month 3)

- Fine-tune resource requests/limits.
- Implement advanced monitoring, alerting, and distributed tracing.
- Strengthen security measures (NetworkPolicies, WAF, external secret management).
- Conduct load testing and performance optimization.
- Regularly review and test disaster recovery plans.

### Phase 4: Scaling & Advanced Features (Month 4 onwards)

- Implement global CDN for API if needed.
- Consider multi-region deployments for high availability.
- Optimize for cost-efficiency.
- Implement advanced security measures like a service mesh.
