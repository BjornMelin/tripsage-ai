# TripSage MCP Integration Strategy

This document provides a comprehensive, actionable integration strategy for TripSage's Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers based on extensive research and evaluation. It serves as the definitive guide for TripSage's API framework, MCP server selection, web data extraction, caching, and browser automation strategies.

## 1. API Framework Strategy

**Recommendation:** Implement a dual-framework approach with **FastAPI** (main API) + **FastMCP** (MCP server components).

- **FastAPI:** Powers TripSage's core web API, handling user authentication, trip management, and client communication.
- **FastMCP:** Provides a standardized framework for building custom MCP servers when required, ensuring consistent implementation patterns.

**Rationale:** This approach leverages FastAPI's robust performance, type safety, and async capabilities for the main application while using FastMCP's specialized MCP development capabilities for custom MCP servers. Both frameworks share Python's typing system and Pydantic models, creating a cohesive development experience.

## 2. MCP Server Strategy for OpenAI Agent Integration

**Recommendation:** Adopt a **hybrid approach** that leverages existing external MCPs for standardized functionality while developing custom FastMCP servers only for core TripSage-specific logic.

**Key Principles:**

1. **External First:** Use existing, well-maintained external MCPs whenever possible.
2. **Custom When Necessary:** Build custom MCPs only when:
   - The functionality is central to TripSage's core business logic
   - Direct database integration is required
   - Privacy/security requirements can't be met with external MCPs
3. **Thin Wrapper Pattern:** Create lightweight wrapper clients around external MCPs that add TripSage-specific validation, error handling, and metrics.
4. **Domain-Based Routing:** Implement intelligent routing for web crawling operations based on domain-specific performance metrics.

**Justification:** This approach minimizes development and maintenance burden while maximizing the benefits of specialized MCP implementations. It allows TripSage to focus development resources on its core travel planning functionality while leveraging the ecosystem of existing MCP servers for common operations.

## 3. Definitive List of External MCP Servers

| **Redis MCP**                    | Distributed caching for performance optimization                     | Implement client in `tripsage/tools/cache_tools.py` with TTL-based caching operations                         |

## 4. Web Data Extraction Strategy

**Recommendation:** Implement a **hybrid web crawling strategy** using domain-specific routing between Crawl4AI and Firecrawl MCPs, with Playwright MCP as a fallback for complex sites.

**Key Components:**

1. **Domain-Based Routing:**

   - Implement `source_selector.py` that routes requests to the optimal crawler based on domain type:
     - **Firecrawl MCP:** For booking sites, commerce platforms, and structured data (Airbnb, Booking.com, etc.)
     - **Crawl4AI MCP:** For informational, content-heavy sites (TripAdvisor, WikiTravel, destination guides)

2. **Result Normalization:**

   - Implement `result_normalizer.py` to transform crawler-specific outputs into a consistent schema
   - Ensure consistent data format regardless of the underlying crawler used

3. **Fallback Mechanism:**

   - Use Playwright MCP for sites that block traditional crawlers
   - Implement escalation logic to attempt Playwright when other crawlers fail
   - Focus on authenticated workflows and complex interactions

4. **Content Aggregator Wrapper:**
   - Build a thin wrapper in `webcrawl_tools.py` that provides a unified interface
   - Implement content enrichment for travel-specific data extraction
   - Utilize WebOperationsCache for performance optimization

**Benefits:** This approach maximizes extraction performance by using domain-specialized tools while presenting a consistent interface to agents. The fallback mechanism ensures reliability when faced with anti-scraping measures.

## 5. Caching Strategy

**Recommendation:** Implement the centralized `WebOperationsCache` system (Issue #38) with content-aware TTL management for all web operations.

**Key Components:**

1. **Content-Type-Based TTL Management:**

   - Implemented `ContentType` enum with five categories:
     - REALTIME (100s): Weather, stocks, flight availability
     - TIME_SENSITIVE (5m): News, social media, events
     - DAILY (1h): Flight prices, hotel availability
     - SEMI_STATIC (8h): Business info, operating hours
     - STATIC (24h): Historical data, destination information

2. **Tool-Specific Implementations:**

   - `CachedWebSearchTool`: Wrapper around OpenAI's WebSearchTool with transparent caching
   - `web_cached` decorator: Apply to other web operations functions
   - Redis-based distributed caching using `redis.asyncio`

3. **Performance Metrics Collection:**

   - Hit/miss tracking with time windows (1h, 24h, 7d)
   - Sampling to reduce Redis overhead
   - Cache size estimation and monitoring

4. **Integration Points:**
   - WebSearchTool usage in TravelPlanningAgent and DestinationResearchAgent
   - Webcrawl operations from Firecrawl and Crawl4AI
   - Browser automation results from Playwright MCP

**Benefits:** This strategy optimizes performance, reduces API costs, and improves response times while ensuring appropriate content freshness based on volatility.

## 6. Browser Automation Strategy

**Recommendation:** Use **Playwright MCP** as the primary browser automation solution, implemented as a fallback mechanism for scenarios where API and crawler approaches fail.

**Key Implementation Aspects:**

1. **Primary Use Cases:**

   - Authenticated workflows (booking verification, user account operations)
   - Sites with strong anti-scraping measures
   - Complex multi-step interactions (checkout processes, etc.)

2. **Implementation Approach:**

   - Configure Playwright MCP server with Python integration
   - Create browser toolkit in `tripsage/tools/browser/tools.py`
   - Implement session persistence for authenticated workflows
   - Add travel-specific browser operations (booking verification, check-ins)
   - Implement anti-detection measures for travel websites

3. **Integration with Web Crawling:**
   - Create clear escalation paths from crawler failures to browser automation
   - Implement result normalization to maintain consistent schema regardless of source
   - Add comprehensive caching for browser automation results

**Rationale:** Playwright MCP provides the most robust, maintained solution for browser automation with excellent Python support. By positioning it as a fallback rather than primary approach, we reduce overhead while ensuring reliability for complex scenarios.

## 7. Gaps & Custom Development Needs

**Recommendation:** Create three custom wrapper MCPs for TripSage-specific functionality that coordinates across multiple external MCPs.

1. **Unified Travel Search Wrapper:**

   - **Purpose:** Aggregate search results across multiple travel data sources
   - **Implementation:** Thin layer coordinating Duffel Flights MCP, Airbnb MCP, and web crawling tools
   - **Key Features:**
     - Unified search parameters and result schema
     - Parallel execution for performance
     - Result ranking and normalization

2. **Trip Planning Coordinator:**

   - **Purpose:** Orchestrate complex planning operations across multiple MCPs
   - **Implementation:** Wrapper that coordinates sequenced MCP operations for trip planning
   - **Key Features:**
     - Itinerary optimization algorithms
     - Constraint satisfaction logic (budget, time, preferences)
     - Coordinated execution of dependent operations

3. **Content Aggregator:**
   - **Purpose:** Provide unified access to travel content from diverse sources
   - **Implementation:** Wrapper around hybrid Crawl4AI/Firecrawl solution
   - **Key Features:**
     - Domain-based source selection
     - Content normalization
     - Comprehensive caching with WebOperationsCache
     - Intelligent fallback to Playwright MCP

**Development Guidelines:**

- Use FastMCP 2.0 for all custom MCP development
- Implement Pydantic v2 models for all schemas
- Use function tool pattern with decorator-based error handling
- Focus on thin coordination layers rather than reimplementing functionality

## 8. Operational Considerations

**Neo4j AuraDB API MCP (Issue #39):**

**Recommendation:** Maintain as **Post-MVP / Low Priority**. Do not implement the Neo4j AuraDB API MCP integration at this time.

**Rationale:**

- TripSage's architecture uses Neo4j as a persistent knowledge graph with stable connections
- Neo4j Memory MCP already provides all needed application-level interactions
- Administrative operations are better handled through Neo4j Aura's web interface
- Dynamic instance management would add unnecessary complexity and security concerns
- KISS/YAGNI principles suggest avoiding this integration until specific operational needs arise

**Implementation Prerequisites (if needed in future):**

- Production decision to use Neo4j AuraDB (not yet determined)
- Clear operational needs requiring programmatic instance management
- Security requirements and access control strategy for administrative operations

## 9. Considerations for Other Evaluated MCPs

| **Browserbase MCP**         | Evaluated, not prioritized      | Alternative if Playwright adoption faces challenges          | Duplicates Playwright capabilities with fewer features           |
| **Exa MCP**                 | Suggested for future evaluation | Alternative web search beyond built-in WebSearchTool         | Initial research shows potential but needs deeper evaluation     |
| **LinkUp MCP**              | Suggested for future evaluation | Additional web search provider for destination research      | Initial research shows potential but needs deeper evaluation     |
| **Sequential Thinking MCP** | Suggested for future evaluation | Complex multi-step travel planning logic                     | May add value for complex reasoning tasks; needs evaluation      |

## 10. Alignment with Software Design Principles

The proposed MCP integration strategy strongly adheres to TripSage's core design principles:

1. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):**

   - Leverages existing MCPs instead of building custom solutions
   - Implements minimal wrapper code around external services
   - Uses direct interfaces rather than complex abstractions

2. **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It):**

   - Defers Neo4j AuraDB API MCP until a concrete need emerges
   - Focuses implementation on immediate travel planning needs
   - Avoids speculative features without clear use cases

3. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):**

   - Standardizes client interfaces across different MCPs
   - Creates reusable abstractions for common patterns
   - Implements WebOperationsCache as a centralized caching solution

4. **SIMPLE:**

   - Prioritizes straightforward integration paths over complex architectures
   - Creates clear boundaries between components
   - Uses consistent patterns across different MCP integrations

5. **Pragmatic Development:**
   - Balances ideal architecture with practical implementation constraints
   - Focuses resources on core travel planning functionality
   - Creates flexible implementation plan with phased delivery
