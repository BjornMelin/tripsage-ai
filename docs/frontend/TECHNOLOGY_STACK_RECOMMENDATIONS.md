- App Router provides better layouts and streaming
- Turbopack for 10x faster development builds
- Native TypeScript support
- Vercel deployment integration
- React Server Components for reduced bundle size

## UI Framework: React 19

**Justification:**
- Stable concurrent features for better UX
- Automatic batching reduces re-renders
- New hooks (useOptimistic, useFormStatus)
- Improved error boundaries
- forwardRef no longer needed
- Better suspense boundaries
- Enhanced developer experience

## Language: TypeScript 5.5+

**Justification:**
- Type safety catches errors early
- Better IDE support and IntelliSense
- Inferred type predicates reduce boilerplate
- Enhanced enum support
- Improved performance
- Better integration with modern tools
- Industry standard for large applications

## Styling: Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui v3

**Justification:**
- OKLCH color space for better color accuracy
- Container queries for component-based responsive design
- Zero-runtime overhead
- shadcn/ui provides accessible components
- Copy-paste component model
- Highly customizable
- Excellent documentation

## State Management: Zustand v5 + TanStack Query v5

**Justification:**
- Zustand: Simple API, TypeScript-first, minimal boilerplate
- TanStack Query: Powerful caching, background refetching, optimistic updates
- Clear separation of client and server state
- Both have excellent DevTools
- Lightweight bundle size
- Easy to test
- Great documentation

## Form Handling: React Hook Form v8 + Zod v3

**Justification:**
- RHF: Performant, minimal re-renders
- Zod: Runtime type validation with TypeScript inference
- Built-in async validation
- Field-level validation
- Works great with server actions
- Excellent error handling
- Small bundle size

## Real-time & AI: Vercel AI SDK v5

**Justification:**
- Native streaming UI support
- Built for AI applications
- Edge runtime compatible
- Great DX with useChat hook
- Supports multiple AI providers
- Built-in error recovery
- Active development and support

## Authentication: Supabase Auth

**Justification:**
- Already integrated with backend
- Social login support
- Row-level security
- JWT tokens
- Session management
- Magic link support
- Well-documented

## Development Tools

### Testing: Vitest + Playwright

**Justification:**
- Vitest: Fast, Jest-compatible, native ESM
- Playwright: Cross-browser testing, reliable, fast
- Both have excellent TypeScript support
- Good integration with CI/CD
- Active communities

### Code Quality: ESLint + Prettier

**Justification:**
- Industry standards
- Extensive rule sets
- Auto-fixable issues
- Git hook integration
- IDE support
- Consistent code style

## Alternative Considerations

### tRPC (Optional)

**When to use:**
- If backend migrates to Node.js
- For internal microservices
- Type-safe API without codegen

**Current recommendation:** Not needed with FastAPI backend

### NextAuth.js v5

**When to use:**
- Multiple OAuth providers needed
- Custom authentication flows
- Enterprise SSO requirements

**Current recommendation:** Stick with Supabase Auth for consistency

### Valtio

**When to use:**
- Complex nested state
- Proxy-based reactivity needed
- Working with mutable data

**Current recommendation:** Zustand covers most needs

## Performance Considerations

1. **Bundle Size**: All chosen libraries are lightweight
2. **Runtime Performance**: No heavy runtime overhead
3. **Developer Experience**: Excellent tooling and documentation
4. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support throughout
5. **Future Proof**: All libraries are actively maintained

## Security Considerations

1. **API Keys**: Never exposed to client
2. **Authentication**: Secure JWT implementation
3. **CSP Headers**: Properly configured
4. **Input Validation**: Zod schemas everywhere
5. **XSS Prevention**: React's built-in protections

## Deployment Considerations

1. **Platform**: Vercel (optimal for Next.js)
2. **Edge Runtime**: Supported where needed
3. **Caching**: ISR and on-demand revalidation
4. **Monitoring**: Vercel Analytics included
5. **Scaling**: Automatic with Vercel

## Conclusion

This technology stack provides:
- Excellent developer experience
- Top-tier performance
- Strong type safety
- Modern AI capabilities
- Scalable architecture
- Active community support

All choices are production-ready and battle-tested in large-scale applications.
