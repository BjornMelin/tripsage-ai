# Source Directory Cleanup Complete

This document summarizes the cleanup of the old `src/` directory following the successful database migration and codebase restructuring.

## Cleanup Summary

### Directories Removed

1. **`src/db/`** - Entire database implementation replaced by MCP-based approach
   - Old client, config, factory, and provider implementations
   - Repository patterns replaced by MCP tools
   - Neo4j specific implementations migrated to Memory MCP
   - SQL migrations now use Supabase MCP

2. **`src/mcp/`** - Refactored into new architecture
   - Old MCP client implementations deleted
   - Functionality moved to `tripsage/mcp_abstraction/` and `tripsage/clients/`
   - New abstraction layer with standardized wrappers

3. **`src/agents/`** - Migrated to tripsage structure
   - Agent files renamed and moved to `tripsage/agents/`
   - Tools migrated to `tripsage/tools/`
   - Configuration moved to `tripsage/config/`

4. **`src/utils/`** - Replaced by enhanced implementations
   - Old utility files superseded by new implementations
   - Dual storage pattern refactored
   - Settings management upgraded

5. **`src/tests/`** - Removed obsolete tests
   - Tests dependent on deleted database layer
   - New tests created for MCP-based approach

### Files Preserved

- **`src/types/supabase.ts`** - TypeScript type definitions
  - Database schema type definitions
  - Still useful for TypeScript projects
  - Not migrated as per migration checklist

## Migration Outcome

- Successfully removed all obsolete code
- No remaining dependencies on deleted files
- Clean separation between old and new implementations
- All functionality preserved in new structure
