# ADR-0008: Migrate to Pydantic v2

**Date**: 2025-06-17

## Status

Accepted

## Context

TripSage's backend currently uses Pydantic v1 for data validation and serialization. However:

- Pydantic v1 is no longer actively developed
- We have 527 failing tests due to v1â†’v2 incompatibilities
- Pydantic v2 offers significant performance improvements (5-50x faster)
- FastAPI fully supports Pydantic v2 with enhanced features
- Modern Python patterns require v2 features

The migration is blocking our ability to:
- Update dependencies
- Use modern validation patterns
- Achieve optimal performance
- Maintain code quality

## Decision

We will migrate completely to Pydantic v2, removing all v1 patterns.

Migration approach:
1. Use `bump-pydantic` tool for automated migration
2. Manually fix remaining issues
3. Update all models to use v2 patterns
4. Remove v1 compatibility shims
5. Optimize for v2 performance features

Key changes:
- Replace `Config` classes with `model_config`
- Update validator decorators to v2 syntax
- Use new serialization methods
- Adopt v2 field definitions

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Performance**: 5-50x faster validation and serialization
- **Features**: Access to new v2 capabilities (discriminated unions, etc.)
- **Maintenance**: Supported version with active development
- **Type Safety**: Better mypy integration and type inference
- **Future Proof**: Enables future FastAPI features
- **Simplicity**: Cleaner syntax and better error messages

### Negative

- **Migration Effort**: 1-2 days of focused work required
- **Breaking Changes**: All models need updates
- **Learning Curve**: Developers need to learn v2 patterns
- **Third-party**: Some libraries may not support v2 yet

### Neutral

- Different import patterns and method names
- New configuration syntax to learn
- Some behavior changes in edge cases

## Alternatives Considered

### Stay on Pydantic v1

Continue using the current version.

**Why not chosen**: 
- No longer maintained
- Blocking dependency updates
- Missing performance improvements
- Technical debt accumulation

### Gradual Migration

Support both v1 and v2 simultaneously.

**Why not chosen**: 
- Increases complexity significantly
- Compatibility layers add overhead
- Extends migration timeline
- More prone to errors

### Alternative Validation Libraries

Switch to attrs, marshmallow, or other libraries.

**Why not chosen**: 
- Would require complete rewrite
- Less FastAPI integration
- Smaller ecosystem
- No clear advantages over Pydantic v2
