# ADR-0001: Use LangGraph for Agent Orchestration

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2025-06-17

## Context

TripSage requires a sophisticated multi-agent system to handle complex travel planning workflows. We need a framework that can:

- Orchestrate multiple specialized agents (flight search, hotel booking, itinerary planning)
- Handle complex state management across agent interactions
- Provide debugging and monitoring capabilities
- Support both synchronous and asynchronous agent execution
- Enable graceful error handling and recovery

The travel planning domain involves numerous interconnected decisions and constraints that require careful coordination between different components.

## Decision

We will use LangGraph as our primary agent orchestration framework.

LangGraph provides:

- A graph-based approach to defining agent workflows
- Built-in state management with checkpointing
- Native support for cycles and conditional branching
- Integration with LangChain ecosystem
- Streaming capabilities for real-time updates
- Built-in debugging and visualization tools

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Structured Workflows**: Graph-based approach makes complex flows easier to understand and maintain
- **State Management**: Built-in checkpointing enables resumable workflows and error recovery
- **Debugging**: Native visualization tools help with development and troubleshooting

## Changelog

- 1.0.0 (2025-10-24) â€” Standardized metadata and formatting; added version and changelog.
- **Ecosystem**: Tight integration with LangChain provides access to numerous tools and integrations
- **Flexibility**: Supports both simple linear flows and complex multi-agent orchestrations

### Negative

- **Learning Curve**: Developers need to understand graph-based programming concepts
- **Overhead**: May be overkill for simple agent interactions
- **Dependency**: Adds another critical dependency to our stack
- **Maturity**: Relatively new framework with evolving APIs

### Neutral

- Requires restructuring existing agent code to fit graph paradigm
- Need to establish patterns for common workflow types
- Documentation and examples are still being developed

## Alternatives Considered

### Raw LangChain Agents

Direct use of LangChain agents without orchestration layer.

**Why not chosen**: Lacks sophisticated state management and workflow coordination needed for complex travel planning scenarios.

### Custom Orchestration Layer

Building our own agent coordination system.

**Why not chosen**: Would require significant development effort and wouldn't provide the debugging tools and ecosystem benefits of LangGraph.

### Temporal/Airflow

Traditional workflow orchestration tools.

**Why not chosen**: Not designed for LLM agent orchestration; would require significant adaptation and lack native LLM features.
