# ADR-0004: FastAPI as Backend Framework

**Date**: 2025-06-17

## Status

Accepted

## Context

TripSage requires a modern, high-performance backend framework that can:

- Handle concurrent AI agent operations efficiently
- Provide automatic API documentation
- Support WebSocket connections for real-time features
- Integrate well with async Python libraries
- Enable rapid API development with strong typing

The backend needs to coordinate multiple external APIs (flights, hotels, weather) while managing AI agent workflows.

## Decision

We will use FastAPI as our primary backend framework.

FastAPI provides:

- Native async/await support for high concurrency
- Automatic OpenAPI/Swagger documentation generation
- Pydantic integration for data validation
- WebSocket support for real-time features
- Excellent performance (on par with Node.js/Go)
- Strong typing with Python type hints

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Performance**: Among the fastest Python frameworks available
- **Developer Experience**: Automatic validation, serialization, and documentation
- **Type Safety**: Catches errors early with Pydantic models
- **Modern Python**: Leverages latest Python features (3.11+)
- **Async Native**: Perfect for I/O-heavy AI agent operations
- **Standards-Based**: Built on OpenAPI and JSON Schema standards

### Negative

- **Ecosystem Size**: Smaller ecosystem compared to Django/Flask
- **Opinionated**: Strong opinions about structure may conflict with preferences
- **Learning Curve**: Async programming requires different thinking
- **Maturity**: Newer framework with evolving best practices

### Neutral

- Requires Python 3.8+ (we use 3.11)
- Different middleware patterns from traditional frameworks
- Need to establish project structure conventions

## Alternatives Considered

### Django + DRF

Django with Django REST Framework.

**Why not chosen**:

- Heavier framework with features we don't need (admin, ORM)
- Synchronous by default, async support is secondary
- More complex for pure API services
- Slower performance for our use case

### Flask

Lightweight Python web framework.

**Why not chosen**:

- Requires many extensions for features FastAPI includes
- No built-in async support
- Manual API documentation
- Less type safety without additional work

### Node.js (Express/Fastify)

JavaScript/TypeScript backend frameworks.

**Why not chosen**:

- Would split our backend language from Python AI/ML ecosystem
- Less mature libraries for AI/ML integration
- Team expertise is primarily in Python
