### Recommendation

**Primary: Hybrid Search Approach with OpenAI WebSearchTool as Foundation**

1. **OpenAI's built-in search for general queries**

   - **Native integration** with the OpenAI Agents SDK via WebSearchTool
   - **Travel-optimized configuration** with allowed/blocked domains for quality results
   - **Simplified implementation** without additional API keys or rate limiting
   - **Autonomous search decisions** made by the agent based on user queries
   - **Cost efficiency** as search is included with standard OpenAI API usage
   - **Customizable domain targeting** to focus on high-quality travel sources
   - **Personal deployment-friendly** with no additional costs for individual users

2. **Complementary specialized tools for depth when needed**

   - **Firecrawl for detailed data extraction** from travel websites
   - **Browser automation for interactive tasks** like checking availability
   - **Web scraping for structured information** about destinations
   - **Advanced search tool adapters** that provide structure around WebSearchTool

3. **Implementation details**
   - **Domain allowlists** targeting specific travel categories:
     - Official airline and accommodation websites
     - Trusted travel guides and information sources
     - Government travel advisories
     - Reliable review platforms
   - **Domain blocklists** to filter out low-quality sources:
     - Content farms and ad-heavy sites
     - Sites with unreliable travel information
   - **Search query templates** optimized for different travel information categories
   - **Caching layer** to improve performance and reduce API costs
   - **Structured tool integration** providing consistent interfaces around WebSearchTool

This hybrid approach uses the OpenAI WebSearchTool for general information queries while maintaining specialized web crawling and browser automation capabilities for deeper research and complex interactions. The combination leverages WebSearchTool's simplicity and broad coverage while enhancing it with domain-specific configuration and structural adapters for travel-specific search patterns. This approach is particularly ideal for personal usage where the user brings their own OpenAI API key.

## Cost Analysis

### Estimated Monthly Costs (Personal Usage - Single User)

| API Service           | Estimated Monthly Cost | Notes                                                       |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Duffel API**        | $0 - $5                | Free tier or minimal cost for personal bookings (1-2 trips) |
| **OpenBnB MCP**       | $0                     | Open-source with negligible self-hosting costs              |
| **Apify Booking.com** | $0 - $3                | Free tier covers ~25 executions/month for personal use      |
| **Google Maps**       | $0                     | Under $200 monthly free credit for personal usage           |
| **OpenAI Search**     | $0 (Included)          | Included with OpenAI API usage for personal agent           |
| **Infrastructure**    | $0 - $5                | Local hosting or minimal cloud resources                    |
| **Total Estimated**   | **$0 - $13**           | Well within free tiers for typical personal usage           |

### Cost Optimization Strategies

1. **Implement aggressive caching**

   - Cache search results, place data, and static maps
   - Implement TTL (time-to-live) based on data volatility

2. **Selective API usage**

   - Use expensive APIs only when necessary
   - Implement request throttling and bundling

3. **Feature-based tiering**
   - Basic tier with limited searches and simpler maps
   - Premium tier with unlimited searches and advanced features

## Implementation Complexity

| API Integration   | Complexity | Development Time Estimate |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ------------------------- |
| Duffel API        | Medium     | 2-3 weeks                 |
| OpenBnB MCP       | Medium     | 1-2 weeks                 |

| Google Maps       | Low-Medium | 1-2 weeks                 |
| Linkup Search     | Low        | <1 week                   |
| MCP Server Setup  | Medium     | 2 weeks                   |
| Overall System    | High       | 6-8 weeks                 |
