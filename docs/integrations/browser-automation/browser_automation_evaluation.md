## OpenAI Agents SDK Integration Analysis

### Playwright Integration

Playwright offers excellent integration with OpenAI Agents SDK through Python:

```python
from agents import Agent, function_tool
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Optional

class FlightStatusParams(BaseModel):
    airline: str
    flight_number: str
    date: str

@function_tool
async def check_flight_status(params: FlightStatusParams) -> str:
    """Check flight status on airline website using Playwright."""
    # Implementation using Playwright MCP server
    # ...
```

Key strengths:

- Native Python support matching OpenAI Agents SDK
- Clean pydantic model integration
- Full support for async/await patterns
- Simple function_tool decorator compatibility

### Stagehand Integration

Stagehand requires a bridge layer for OpenAI Agents SDK:

```python
from agents import Agent, function_tool
from pydantic import BaseModel
import asyncio
import subprocess

class FlightStatusParams(BaseModel):
    airline: str
    flight_number: str
    date: str

@function_tool
async def check_flight_status(params: FlightStatusParams) -> str:
    """Check flight status on airline website using Stagehand."""
    # Call Stagehand via Node.js bridge
    # ...
```

Key considerations:

- Requires JavaScript-Python bridge
- Higher complexity but superior resilience
- Additional subprocess management needed
- LLM API costs for AI features

### Browser-use Integration

Browser-use integration with OpenAI Agents SDK:

```python
from agents import Agent, function_tool
from pydantic import BaseModel
import httpx

class FlightStatusParams(BaseModel):
    airline: str
    flight_number: str
    date: str

@function_tool
async def check_flight_status(params: FlightStatusParams) -> str:
    """Check flight status on airline website using Browser-use."""
    # Call Browser-use API
    # ...
```

Key limitations:

- Requires HTTP API calls to JavaScript service
- Limited to 100 minutes/month on free tier
- Less direct integration with Python ecosystem
- Higher latency due to additional network hops

## FastMCP 2.0 Compatibility Analysis

### Playwright Compatibility

Playwright has excellent compatibility with FastMCP 2.0:

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP, ToolDefinition
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastMCP()

class FlightStatusParams(BaseModel):
    airline: str
    flight_number: str
    date: str

@app.tool
async def check_flight_status(params: FlightStatusParams):
    # Playwright implementation
    # ...
```

Key strengths:

- Native Python support
- Async-first design matching FastMCP patterns
- Clean Pydantic model integration
- Excellent type hinting and documentation

### Stagehand Compatibility

Stagehand requires additional integration for FastMCP 2.0:

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP, ToolDefinition
from pydantic import BaseModel
import asyncio
import subprocess

app = FastMCP()

@app.tool
async def check_flight_status(params: dict):
    # Stagehand bridge implementation
    # ...
```

Key considerations:

- Requires custom integration layer
- Higher implementation complexity
- Additional process management
- Language barrier between JavaScript and Python
