## Ranked Recommendations for TripSage

Based on compatibility with TripSage and the travel planning context, here are the recommended Weather MCP servers:

1. **szypetike/weather-mcp-server (OpenWeather API)** - **Best Overall Choice**

   - Global coverage essential for travel planning
   - Mock data mode perfect for development and testing
   - Comprehensive weather data
   - OpenWeather is a reliable and established provider

2. **adhikasp/mcp-weather (AccuWeather API)** - **Best Python Implementation**

   - Python-based implementation aligns well with TripSage's tech stack
   - Hourly forecast functionality is valuable for travel planning
   - AccuWeather provides high-quality global weather data

3. **TuanKiri/weather-mcp-server (WeatherAPI)** - **Best Structured Implementation**

   - Professional code organization
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Docker support provides deployment flexibility
   - Global coverage meets travel planning needs

4. **jdhettema/mcp-weather-sse (OpenWeatherMap with SSE)** - **Best for Real-time Updates**

   - Real-time capabilities through SSE
   - Python implementation with MCP SDK
   - Global coverage with OpenWeatherMap

5. **michael7736/weather-mcp-server (National Weather Service)** - **Best for US-only Travel**
   - Free without API key requirements
   - US-specific data may be more detailed
   - Limited to US locations, which is a significant drawback for global travel planning

## Integration Recommendation

We recommend integrating **szypetike/weather-mcp-server** as the primary Weather MCP server for TripSage. Its OpenWeather API implementation, global coverage, and mock data capabilities make it ideal for both development and production use. The mock data mode will be particularly useful during development and testing phases.

For a fully Python-based alternative, **adhikasp/mcp-weather** would be the recommended choice, leveraging AccuWeather's reliable global weather data.

Our existing TripSage implementation already uses OpenWeatherMap API through a custom implementation. Moving to an external MCP server would align with our strategy of prioritizing external MCPs when possible, reserving custom implementations for core business logic or when privacy/security requirements can't be met externally.
