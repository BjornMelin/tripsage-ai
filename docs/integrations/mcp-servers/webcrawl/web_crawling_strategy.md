# TripSage Web Crawling Strategy

## Executive Summary

After extensive evaluation of Crawl4AI, Firecrawl, and various browser automation tools, we recommend implementing a **hybrid web crawling strategy** for TripSage. This approach combines the strengths of multiple tools, each optimized for specific website types and crawling scenarios.

## Recommended Architecture

1. **Primary Crawling Layer**
   - **Crawl4AI MCP**: Optimized for informational/content-heavy sites
   - **Firecrawl MCP**: Optimized for booking platforms and JS-heavy sites
   - **Domain-based Router**: Directs requests to the appropriate crawler

2. **Browser Automation Layer**
   - **Playwright MCP**: Fallback for sites requiring authentication or complex interactions
   - **Triggered only when crawlers encounter limitations**

3. **Caching Layer**
   - **Redis MCP**: Standardized caching across all web data sources
   - **TTL based on content type**: Short TTL for prices, longer TTL for destination info

## Tool Comparison

| Feature | Crawl4AI | Firecrawl | Playwright |
|---------|----------|-----------|------------|
| **Architecture** | Self-hosted, open-source | Cloud API with MCP server | Self-hosted browser automation |
| **Performance** | 4x faster in benchmarks | Strong reliability focus | Best for complex interactions |
| **Extraction Accuracy** | 97% accuracy reported | High with LLM enhancement | Complete DOM access |
| **JS Support** | Good with configuration | Excellent out-of-box | Comprehensive |
| **Ideal Use Cases** | Informational sites | Booking sites | Authentication workflows |
| **Cost** | Infrastructure only | Free tier + paid plans | Free (open source) |
| **Integration** | More complex | Well-documented API | Python native |
| **MCP Maturity** | Multiple implementations | Official, well-maintained | Established ecosystem |

## Domain-Specific Routing

Based on empirical evidence, we recommend the following domain-based routing rules:

### Crawl4AI Optimized Sites
- tripadvisor.com
- wikitravel.org  
- wikipedia.org
- lonelyplanet.com
- travel.state.gov
- flyertalk.com

### Firecrawl Optimized Sites
- airbnb.com
- booking.com
- expedia.com
- hotels.com
- kayak.com
- trip.com
- eventbrite.com
- timeout.com

## Playwright MCP Usage Guidelines

Playwright should be used as a fallback when:

1. Sites actively block crawler access
2. Authentication is required (login, session persistence)
3. Complex multi-step workflows are needed
4. Visual verification is necessary

Implement clear escalation logic that tries the appropriate crawler first, then falls back to Playwright when specific error conditions are detected.

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Unified Abstraction Layer**
   - Create consistent interface regardless of underlying crawler
   - Implement in `tripsage/tools/webcrawl_tools.py`

2. **Source Selection**
   - Implement domain-based routing in `tripsage/tools/webcrawl/source_selector.py`
   - Develop empirical performance testing to refine routing rules

3. **Result Normalization**
   - Create consistent output schema in `tripsage/tools/webcrawl/models.py`
   - Ensure unified output format regardless of source

4. **Error Handling**
   - Implement comprehensive retry logic
   - Add fallback patterns between crawlers
   - Create clear escalation to browser automation

5. **Caching Strategy**
   - Implement Redis MCP for standardized caching
   - Set TTL based on content type (prices vs. destination info)
   - Develop cache warming for common travel destinations

## Performance Considerations

Our hybrid approach maximizes performance by:

1. Using the faster Crawl4AI for high-volume informational queries
2. Leveraging Firecrawl's reliability for critical booking data
3. Maintaining Playwright as a fallback for complex scenarios
4. Implementing comprehensive caching to reduce redundant requests

## Conclusion

This hybrid strategy provides TripSage with a robust, performant web data extraction capability that leverages the unique strengths of each tool. The domain-based routing ensures optimal performance across different travel website categories, while the layered approach with browser automation fallback ensures maximum coverage and reliability.

The implementation should follow the modular, well-tested patterns already established in the TripSage architecture, with a focus on error handling, caching, and seamless integration with the agent system.
