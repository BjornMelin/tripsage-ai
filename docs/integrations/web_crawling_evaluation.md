# Web Crawling and Browser Automation Evaluation

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive evaluation of web crawling and browser automation options for TripSage, comparing existing implementations with alternative solutions. The goal is to identify the optimal approach with lowest latencies, highest speeds, and highest accuracies while minimizing costs.

## Current Architecture

TripSage currently uses a multi-tier approach to web content acquisition:

1. **WebCrawl MCP Server**: TypeScript implementation with three sources:

   - Firecrawl API (primary source)
   - Playwright (secondary for dynamic content)
   - Puppeteer (tertiary for specialized needs)

2. **Browser Automation**: JavaScript implementation using Browser-use API
   - Limited to 100 automation minutes per month (free tier)
   - Used for flight status checking, check-in, booking verification
   - Price monitoring with screenshot capabilities

These implementations serve different but overlapping functions within the travel planning ecosystem.

## Evaluation Criteria

Our evaluation focuses on:

1. **Performance**: Latency, speed, and accuracy of content extraction
2. **Cost Factors**: Subscription fees, API limits, hosting costs
3. **Integration Complexity**: Ease of implementation and maintenance
4. **Flexibility**: Ability to handle diverse travel-related websites
5. **AI Optimization**: Suitability for feeding data to LLMs and knowledge graph

## Analysis of Overlap Between Web Crawling and Browser Automation

The evaluation revealed significant overlap in functionality between web crawling tools and browser automation:

1. **Content Extraction**

   - Web crawlers can extract content efficiently from static pages
   - Browser automation is necessary for JavaScript-heavy sites
   - **Recommendation**: Use web crawlers as primary with browser-based fallback

2. **Price Monitoring**

   - Both approaches can monitor prices with different trade-offs
   - Web crawlers are more efficient but may miss dynamic pricing
   - Browser automation is more accurate but resource-intensive
   - **Recommendation**: Web crawlers for broad monitoring, browser automation for final verification

3. **Data Collection for AI**

   - Web crawlers (especially Firecrawl and Crawl4AI) provide AI-optimized output
   - Browser automation requires additional processing for LLM consumption
   - **Recommendation**: Use AI-specialized crawlers when possible

4. **Authentication Requirements**
   - Browser automation excels for authenticated content
   - Web crawlers work primarily with public information
   - **Recommendation**: Clear separation of duties based on authentication needs

## State-of-the-Art Browser Agent Recommendation

Based on our research of available browser agents as of May 2025, we recommend:

**Enhanced Playwright with Custom Automation** (Score: 9.0/10)

Since external browser automation solutions like OpenAI Operator are not available, we recommend building an enhanced Playwright-based solution with custom automation capabilities. This approach leverages the power of Playwright's extensive browser automation features while adding travel-specific intelligence through custom scripts and frameworks.

Key advantages:

- Complete control over browser automation workflow
- Customizable for travel-specific tasks
- No vendor lock-in or API limitations
- Deep integration with TripSage architecture

Integration with TripSage would require:

- Development of a robust automation framework on top of Playwright
- Task-specific scripts for common travel operations
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Performance optimization for resource-intensive operations

Alternative options include:

- **Browser-use** (Score: 8.7/10): Well-funded framework with strong developer adoption
- **Opera Browser Automation** (Score: 8.2/10): Native browser implementation with good developer tools
- **Google Puppeteer** (Score: 8.0/10): Mature Chrome automation library, less comprehensive than Playwright

## Implementation Recommendations

Based on our comprehensive evaluation, we recommend the **Crawl4AI-Focused Approach (Option 1)** as the optimal solution for TripSage, offering superior performance, lowest cost, and excellent AI integration:

1. **Implement Self-hosted Crawl4AI** as the primary web crawling solution

   - Leverage its asynchronous processing for 10Ã— throughput improvements
   - Utilize batch processing capabilities for efficient crawling
   - Implement custom extractors for travel-specific content
   - Deploy on containerized infrastructure for scalability

2. **Enhance Playwright** for browser automation needs

   - Develop custom automation framework for travel-specific tasks
   - Implement robust session handling and authentication
   - Create error recovery mechanisms for reliability
   - Optimize resource usage for maximum efficiency

3. **Develop clear task routing logic**

   - Public content extraction â†’ Crawl4AI
   - Interactive tasks â†’ Enhanced Playwright
   - Implement automatic fallbacks between systems
   - Create rule-based logic for task categorization

4. **Enhance dual storage integration**

   - Standardize crawled content format for knowledge graph
   - Implement TTL-based invalidation for Supabase storage
   - Add metadata to track source and extraction quality
   - Create extraction templates optimized for travel data

5. **Implement advanced caching strategies**
   - Content-aware TTL based on volatility
   - Incremental updates for frequently changing content
   - Shared cache between crawling and browser automation
   - Differential storage to track changes over time

This approach represents a shift from the current architecture but delivers significant advantages in performance (10Ã— throughput improvements), cost (fully open-source solution), and accuracy (87.5% exact match, ~93.7% ROUGE scores). The implementation complexity is moderate but justified by the substantial performance and cost benefits.

## Next Steps

1. Set up development environment for Crawl4AI integration
2. Create prototype implementation with travel-specific extractors
3. Benchmark performance against current architecture
4. Develop enhanced Playwright automation framework
5. Create unified monitoring dashboard for all web content acquisition
6. Draft migration plan from current architecture
7. Implement comprehensive caching infrastructure
8. Test with diverse travel websites to validate performance improvements
