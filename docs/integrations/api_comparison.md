## Cost Analysis

### Estimated Monthly Costs (Based on 10,000 users)

| API Service           | Estimated Monthly Cost | Notes                                                  |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Duffel API**        | $1,000 - $2,500        | Based on 5,000 bookings at $0.20-$0.50 per transaction |
| **OpenBnB MCP**       | $0                     | Open-source with self-hosting costs only               |
| **Apify Booking.com** | $300 - $500            | Based on 10,000 searches at $0.03-$0.05 per execution  |
| **Google Maps**       | $300 - $800            | After $200 free credit, varies by usage                |
| **Linkup Search**     | $200 - $400            | Based on selective usage for specialized queries       |
| **Infrastructure**    | $500 - $1,000          | Servers, databases, and MCP hosting                    |
| **Total Estimated**   | **$2,300 - $5,200**    | Scales with usage                                      |

### Cost Optimization Strategies

1. **Implement aggressive caching**

   - Cache search results, place data, and static maps
   - Implement TTL (time-to-live) based on data volatility

2. **Selective API usage**

   - Use expensive APIs only when necessary
   - Implement request throttling and bundling

3. **Feature-based tiering**
   - Basic tier with limited searches and simpler maps
   - Premium tier with unlimited searches and advanced features

## Implementation Complexity

| API Integration   | Complexity | Development Time Estimate |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ------------------------- |
| Duffel API        | Medium     | 2-3 weeks                 |
| OpenBnB MCP       | Medium     | 1-2 weeks                 |
