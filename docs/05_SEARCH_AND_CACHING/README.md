# Search and Caching Strategies

This section details the comprehensive strategies and implementations for search functionalities and caching mechanisms within the TripSage AI Travel Planning System. Effective search and caching are critical for providing users with fast, relevant, and up-to-date travel information while optimizing resource usage and API costs.

## Contents

- **[Search Strategy](./SEARCH_STRATEGY.md)**:

  - Outlines TripSage's hybrid search approach, which combines the capabilities of OpenAI's WebSearchTool, specialized web crawling via the WebCrawl MCP, and interactive browser automation via the BrowserAutomation MCP. This document explains the tool selection logic, an overview of how different search tools are configured and used for travel-specific queries, and how results are aggregated and presented.

- **[Caching Strategy and Implementation](./CACHING_STRATEGY_AND_IMPLEMENTATION.md)**:
  - Provides a detailed guide to TripSage's multi-level caching architecture, primarily leveraging Redis. It covers cache key generation, content-aware Time-To-Live (TTL) policies, cache invalidation strategies, integration with various MCP clients and services (including WebSearchTool and WebCrawl MCP), and monitoring for cache performance. This document also includes specifics on rate limiting management using Redis.

## Purpose

The documents in this section aim to:

- Explain how TripSage gathers information from the web and internal data sources to answer user queries and plan trips.
- Detail the mechanisms used to improve search performance, reduce latency, and manage costs associated with external API calls.
- Provide implementation guidelines for developers working on search-related features or data retrieval components.
- Ensure a consistent and optimized approach to data caching across the entire system.

Understanding these strategies is essential for developing efficient and responsive features in TripSage that rely on data retrieval and processing.
