# MCP Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for integrating Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers into the TripSage travel planning system.

## Executive Summary

TripSage will implement a suite of specialized MCP servers to enhance its travel planning capabilities. This approach leverages the Python FastMCP 2.0 framework to create standalone servers that provide dedicated functionality for weather data, web crawling, flights, accommodations, calendar integration, and knowledge management. The system will utilize official MCP servers where appropriate (Neo4j Memory, Time) and build custom implementations for travel-specific services.

The implementation follows a phased approach over 8 weeks, starting with the core infrastructure integration (Neo4j Memory and database setup), followed by essential travel services (Flights and Accommodations), and finally the advanced features (Calendar and Web Crawling).

## Architecture Overview

The architecture consists of three main layers:

1. **MCP Server Layer**: Specialized servers built with Python FastMCP 2.0
2. **Integration Layer**: Client adapters and unified interfaces
3. **Agent Layer**: OpenAI Agents SDK integration with tools

- Row-Level Security (RLS) for multi-tenant data
- Reliable cold-start behavior for production usage

### Neon (Development)

- Development, testing, and preview environments
- Unlimited free database branches
- Instant database cloning for developer environments
- Database branching tied to git workflow

### Integration Strategy

- Common schema definition across both platforms
- Abstraction layer to handle provider-specific features
- Migration scripts compatible with both systems
- CI/CD integration leveraging Neon's branching capabilities
