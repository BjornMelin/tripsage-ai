# Browser Automation MCP Integration Guide

This document provides a comprehensive guide to TripSage's browser automation strategy, focusing on the integration of external MCP servers like Playwright MCP and Stagehand MCP for tasks requiring direct browser interaction.

## 1. Overview and Strategy

Browser automation is essential for:

- Checking real-time flight status on airline websites.
- Automating check-in procedures.
- Verifying booking details on sites lacking APIs.
- Capturing screenshots for verification.
- Monitoring dynamic price changes.

**Strategy**: Leverage specialized external MCP servers (Playwright, Stagehand) rather than building a custom Browser MCP in-house.

## 2. Evaluation of Technologies

- **Playwright**: Fast, cross-browser, strong Python support, free.
- **Stagehand**: Playwright-based, adds AI-driven resilience to DOM changes, more complexity.
- **Selenium**: Slower, flakier.
- **Browser-use**: Deprecated. Playwright is superior.

**Decision**: Use **Playwright MCP** as primary, with potential future Stagehand integration.

## 3. Playwright MCP Server Integration

- Exposes tools: `playwright_navigate`, `playwright_click`, `playwright_fill`, `playwright_screenshot`, etc.
- Config in `.env`: `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_ENDPOINT`, possibly `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_API_KEY`.

## 4. TripSage BrowserAutomationClient

- Python client that invokes Playwright MCP's tools.
- Provides session management (browser contexts).
- Tools: `navigate`, `click`, `fill`, `get_text`, `screenshot`, `close_session`.

## 5. Agent Tools

- High-level tools for tasks like `check_flight_status_on_website`, `verify_booking_on_website`.
- Possibly uses a `BrowserService` for multi-step automation.

## 6. Performance and Resource Management

- Reuse browser contexts, run headless, set timeouts, close sessions to avoid leaks.

## 7. Error Handling and Resilience

- Use robust selectors, wait strategies, retry, screenshot on failure.
- Fallback methods if automation fails.

## 8. Security Considerations

- Sanitize user inputs, handle credentials securely.
- Scrape only publicly available data.

## 9. Conclusion

By integrating external Playwright and Stagehand MCPs, TripSage achieves reliable, flexible browser automation without building from scratch. The `BrowserAutomationClient` and specialized agent tools let AI agents perform complex web interactions for real-time travel tasks.
