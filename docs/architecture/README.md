# TripSage System Architecture

> **Target Audience**: Technical architects, senior developers, technical stakeholders, integration partners

This section contains high-level system design and architectural documentation for TripSage. Architecture documentation focuses on system design decisions, component interactions, and technology stack choices rather than implementation details.

## Documentation Scope

**Architecture Documentation Includes:**

- System design patterns and architectural decisions
- Component interaction diagrams and data flow
- Technology stack choices and rationale
- Performance architecture and scalability patterns
- Security architecture and access patterns
- Integration architecture with external systems
- Cross-cutting concerns (caching, messaging, storage)

**Architecture Documentation Excludes:**

- Implementation details and code examples → See [`docs/developers/`](../developers/)
- Deployment procedures and operations → See [`docs/operators/`](../operators/)
- API specifications and endpoints → See [`docs/api-reference/`](../api-reference/)
- Configuration and setup guides → See [`docs/configuration/`](../configuration/)

## Architecture Documents

### Core System Architecture

- **[System Overview](system-overview.md)** - Complete system architecture with component interactions, data flow, and technology stack
- **[Data Architecture](data-architecture.md)** - Database design patterns, storage decisions, and vector search optimization
- **[Frontend Architecture](frontend-architecture.md)** - Next.js application structure, AI SDK v6 integration, component organization, and data flows

### Specialized Architecture

- **[Storage Architecture](storage-architecture.md)** - File storage, bucket organization, and security patterns

## Architecture Principles

TripSage follows these core architectural principles:

### 1. **Unified Data Architecture**

Single source of truth with Supabase PostgreSQL, eliminating complex multi-database patterns while supporting real-time features and vector operations.

### 2. **Consumer-Aware API Design**

API layer adapts responses and behavior based on consumer type (frontend applications vs AI agents).

### 3. **Serverless Caching**

Serverless caching with Upstash Redis (HTTP), integrated via Vercel environment variables, eliminating local cache containers and connection pooling.

### 4. **Service Consolidation**

Direct SDK integrations replacing complex abstraction layers, reducing latency and improving maintainability while preserving functionality.

### 5. **Real-time Collaboration**

Supabase Realtime-based architecture for live trip planning, agent status updates, and multi-user collaboration.

### Module Organization

#### `tripsage/api/`

FastAPI application entry point and core API logic with consumer-aware design.

#### `tripsage_core/`

Core business logic, services, models, and shared utilities:

- `config.py` - Configuration management
- `exceptions.py` - Custom exception handling
- `models/` - Pydantic models and Supabase schemas
- `services/business/` - Business logic services
- `services/external_apis/` - Direct SDK integrations
- `services/infrastructure/` - Database, cache, Supabase Realtime integration

#### `frontend/`

Next.js 16 application with App Router and React 19. See [Frontend Architecture](frontend-architecture.md) for detailed structure, AI SDK v6 integration, and component organization.

#### `tests/`

Test suite with 90%+ coverage:

- `unit/` - Unit tests for individual components
- `integration/` - Service integration tests
- `e2e/` - End-to-end Playwright tests
- `performance/` - Performance and load tests
- `security/` - Security and compliance tests
