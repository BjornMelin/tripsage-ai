# TripSage System Architecture

> **Target Audience**: Technical architects, senior developers, technical stakeholders, integration partners

This section contains high-level system design and architectural documentation for TripSage. Architecture documentation focuses on system design decisions, component interactions, and technology stack choices rather than implementation details.

## üìã Documentation Scope

**‚úÖ Architecture Documentation Includes:**
- System design patterns and architectural decisions
- Component interaction diagrams and data flow
- Technology stack choices and rationale
- Performance architecture and scalability patterns
- Security architecture and access patterns
- Integration architecture with external systems
- Cross-cutting concerns (caching, messaging, storage)

**‚ùå Architecture Documentation Excludes:**
- Implementation details and code examples ‚Üí See [`docs/developers/`](../developers/)
- Deployment procedures and operations ‚Üí See [`docs/operators/`](../operators/) 
- API specifications and endpoints ‚Üí See [`docs/api-reference/`](../api-reference/)
- Configuration and setup guides ‚Üí See [`docs/configuration/`](../configuration/)

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Documents

### Core System Architecture
- **[System Overview](system-overview.md)** - Complete system architecture with component interactions
- **[Technology Stack](technology-stack.md)** - Architecture-level technology decisions and rationale
- **[Data Architecture](data-architecture.md)** - Database design patterns and storage decisions

### Communication Architecture  
- **[Real-time Communication](real-time-communication.md)** - WebSocket and real-time messaging patterns
- **[API Architecture](api-architecture.md)** - High-level API design patterns and consumer strategies
- **[Integration Patterns](integration-patterns.md)** - External service integration architecture

### Cross-cutting Concerns
- **[Performance Architecture](performance-architecture.md)** - Caching, optimization, and scalability patterns
- **[Security Architecture](security-architecture.md)** - Authentication, authorization, and data protection patterns
- **[Monitoring Architecture](monitoring-architecture.md)** - Observability and system health patterns

## üéØ Architecture Principles

TripSage follows these core architectural principles:

### 1. **Unified Data Architecture**
Single source of truth with Supabase PostgreSQL, eliminating complex multi-database patterns while supporting real-time features and vector operations.

### 2. **Consumer-Aware API Design**
API layer adapts responses and behavior based on consumer type (frontend applications vs AI agents), providing optimal experience for each use case.

### 3. **Performance-First Caching**
Multi-tier caching strategy with DragonflyDB providing 25x performance improvement over traditional Redis implementations.

### 4. **Service Consolidation**
Direct SDK integrations replacing complex abstraction layers, reducing latency and improving maintainability while preserving functionality.

### 5. **Real-time Collaboration**
WebSocket-based architecture enabling live trip planning, agent status updates, and multi-user collaboration with conflict resolution.
