    participant API as Unified API
    participant Core as TripSage Core
    participant LG as LangGraph
    participant DB as Supabase
    participant Cache as Upstash Redis
    participant Ext as External APIs

    U->>API: Request (JWT/API Key)
    API->>API: Consumer Detection & Auth
    API->>Core: Route to Business Service
    Core->>Cache: Check Cache
    
    alt Cache Hit
        Cache->>Core: Return Cached Data
    else Cache Miss
        Core->>LG: Invoke Agent if Complex
        LG->>Ext: Direct SDK Calls
        Ext->>LG: Return Data
        LG->>DB: Store Results
        DB->>Core: Confirm Storage
        Core->>Cache: Update Cache
    end
    
    Core->>API: Return Response
    API->>API: Format for Consumer
    API->>U: Consumer-Specific Response
```

### Memory and Context Flow

The memory system uses a context pipeline:

1. Memory Retrieval: Vector similarity search retrieves
   context
2. Context Aggregation: Conversation history and user
   preferences combined
3. Agent Processing: LangGraph agents process with context
   awareness
4. Memory Persistence: Insights stored for future use
