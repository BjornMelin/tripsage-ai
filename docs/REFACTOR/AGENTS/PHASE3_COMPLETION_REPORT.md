- ✅ **All Linting Passes** (ruff check & format)
- ✅ **No Regressions** in existing functionality
- ✅ **Performance Validated** with async operations

## 🏗️ Architecture Achievements

### MCP Integration Pattern
Successfully implemented the bridge pattern to preserve existing MCP functionality while adding LangGraph compatibility:

```python
# Before: Direct MCP calls
result = await self.mcp_manager.invoke(tool_name, params)

# After: LangGraph-compatible tools
tools = await self.mcp_bridge.get_tools()
result = await self.mcp_bridge.invoke_tool_direct(tool_name, params)
```

### Memory Integration Pattern
Achieved seamless integration between LangGraph state and Neo4j memory:

```python
# State hydration from memory
state = await memory_bridge.hydrate_state(initial_state)

# Insight extraction and persistence  
insights = await memory_bridge.extract_and_persist_insights(final_state)
```

### Checkpoint Integration Pattern
Implemented robust PostgreSQL checkpointing with fallback support:

```python
# Production: PostgreSQL checkpointing
checkpointer = await checkpoint_manager.get_async_checkpointer()

# Development: MemorySaver fallback (automatic)
if not POSTGRES_AVAILABLE:
    checkpointer = MemorySaver()
```

## 🚀 Performance Improvements

### Achieved Optimizations
- **Async Operations**: Full async/await support across all components
- **Connection Pooling**: PostgreSQL connection optimization for checkpointing
- **Tool Caching**: Efficient tool registry caching in MCP bridge
- **State Management**: Streamlined state hydration and persistence

### Error Handling Enhancements
