dispatcher = MemoryAdaptiveDispatcher(
    memory_threshold_percent=80.0,  # Auto-throttle at 80% memory
    check_interval=0.5,             # Check every 0.5 seconds
    max_session_permit=20,          # Max concurrent sessions
    monitor=CrawlerMonitor(         # Real-time monitoring
        display_mode=DisplayMode.DETAILED
    )
)

# High-performance crawling with streaming
async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
    async for result in await crawler.arun_many(
        urls=urls,
        config=CrawlerRunConfig(stream=True),
        dispatcher=dispatcher
    ):
        # Process results in real-time
        await process_result(result)
```

#### 2. Native Playwright Python SDK (15% for complex sites)

```python
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright

# Direct browser automation with full API access
async with async_playwright() as p:
    browser = await p.chromium.launch()
    context = await browser.new_context()
    page = await context.new_page()

    # Full control over browser interactions
    await page.goto(url)
    await page.wait_for_load_state('networkidle')
    content = await page.content()
```

#### 3. Intelligent Router System

```python
class SmartCrawlerRouter:
    def select_engine(self, url: str, content_type: str) -> CrawlerEngine:
        # JavaScript complexity detection
