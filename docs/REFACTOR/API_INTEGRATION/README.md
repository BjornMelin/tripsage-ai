# API Integration Refactoring Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive research and planning documentation for
migrating TripSage from MCP (Model Context Protocol) server wrappers to direct
API/SDK integration.

## Documents

### 1. [MCP_TO_SDK_MIGRATION_RESEARCH.md](./MCP_TO_SDK_MIGRATION_RESEARCH.md)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive analysis comparing MCP server wrappers vs direct SDK
integration for all 12 external services used by TripSage.

**Key Contents**:

- Current MCP architecture analysis (323 lines in manager.py, 470 lines in settings)
- Service-by-service evaluation matrix with 7 criteria scored 1-5
- Performance, maintainability, and developer experience comparisons
- Research methodology using Context7, Firecrawl, Exa, Tavily, and Sequential
  Thinking tools
- Final recommendations for each service

**Key Finding**: 8 of 12 services should migrate to direct SDK integration,
expected 40% performance improvement and 2000+ lines code reduction.

### 2. [MCP_TO_SDK_MIGRATION_PLAN.md](./MCP_TO_SDK_MIGRATION_PLAN.md)

**Purpose**: Detailed implementation plan with code examples, timelines, and
rollback strategies for migrating from MCP to direct SDKs.

**Key Contents**:

- Phase-by-phase migration plan across 3 sprints (23-34 development days)
- Complete code examples for Redis, Supabase, and Neo4j migrations
- Feature flag system for zero-downtime deployment
- Performance testing and validation strategies
- Monitoring, alerting, and rollback procedures

**Implementation Priority**:

- **Tier 1 (HIGH)**: Redis, Supabase, Neo4j - immediate 30-50% latency reduction
- **Tier 2 (MEDIUM)**: Time, Duffel Flights, Google Calendar, Google Maps
- **Tier 3 (LOW)**: Firecrawl, Weather
- **Keep MCP**: Playwright, Crawl4AI, Airbnb

## Quick Reference

### Services to Migrate (8/12)

| Service             | Current Lines | After Migration | Priority | Expected Benefit                       |
| ------------------- | ------------- | --------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Redis**           | 394           | ~50             | HIGH     | 50-70% latency improvement             |
| **Supabase**        | 139           | ~20             | HIGH     | 30-40% faster, full API access         |
| **Neo4j**           | 91            | ~30             | HIGH     | Full Cypher support, ACID transactions |
| **Time**            | ~80           | ~20             | MEDIUM   | Network â†’ Local computation            |
| **Duffel Flights**  | ~120          | ~40             | MEDIUM   | Full API access                        |
| **Google Calendar** | ~110          | ~50             | MEDIUM   | Official client reliability            |
| **Google Maps**     | ~150          | ~60             | MEDIUM   | Full Maps Platform access              |
| **Firecrawl**       | ~130          | ~40             | LOW      | Incremental improvement                |

### Services to Keep MCP (3/12)

| Service        | Reason to Keep MCP                             |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Playwright** | Process isolation for security and reliability |
| **Crawl4AI**   | AI workload resource isolation                 |
| **Airbnb**     | Unofficial API complexity management           |

## Migration Timeline

```text
Week 1-2:  Sprint 1.1 - Redis Migration
Week 3-4:  Sprint 1.2 - Supabase Migration
Week 5:    Sprint 2 - Neo4j Migration
Week 6:    Sprint 3 - Time Operations
Week 7-8:  Sprint 4 - Duffel Flights
Week 9-10: Sprint 5 - Google Services
Week 11:   Sprint 6 - Low Priority Services
Week 12:   Final Testing & Validation
```

## Key Benefits

- **Performance**: 30-50% latency reduction for database/cache operations
- **Maintainability**: ~2000 lines of wrapper code eliminated
- **Developer Experience**: Direct SDK access, better IDE support
- **Reliability**: Fewer network hops, official client support
- **Cost**: Reduced infrastructure complexity

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve migration strategy
2. Allocate development resources (2-3 senior developers)
3. Set up feature flag infrastructure
4. Begin with Tier 1 migrations (Redis, Supabase, Neo4j)
5. Monitor performance improvements and iterate
