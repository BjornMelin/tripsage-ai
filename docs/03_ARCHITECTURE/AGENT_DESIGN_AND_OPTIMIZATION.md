# TripSage Agent Design and Optimization

> **Status**: ✅ **Production Ready** - LangGraph Phase 3 Completed (May 2025)

This document details the architecture, design principles, and optimization strategies for AI agents within the TripSage system. The system has been fully migrated to **LangGraph-based orchestration** with PostgreSQL checkpointing, integrated memory management, and production-ready agent coordination.

## 1. Agent Architecture Philosophy

TripSage employs a **graph-based agent orchestration** system built on LangGraph. This design provides:

- **Graph-Based Workflow**: Deterministic, trackable agent execution flows with state persistence
- **Specialized Agent Nodes**: Each agent focuses on a specific domain (flights, accommodations, budget, etc.)
- **Intelligent Routing**: Dynamic agent selection based on context and conversation state
- **State Persistence**: PostgreSQL checkpointing for conversation continuity and recovery
- **Memory Integration**: Intelligent memory management with Mem0 + pgvector for contextual retrieval
- **Error Recovery**: Built-in error handling with retry mechanisms and graceful degradation

## 2. Core Framework: LangGraph Orchestration

TripSage has migrated from the OpenAI Agents SDK to **LangGraph** for enhanced performance, reliability, and production capabilities.

### Key Advantages of LangGraph Architecture

- **Stateful Conversations**: PostgreSQL-backed state persistence across sessions
- **Graph-Based Orchestration**: Deterministic workflow execution with conditional branching
- **Production Scalability**: Built for high-throughput, multi-user environments
- **Advanced Memory**: Integrated with Mem0 + pgvector for contextual memory retrieval
- **Checkpoint Recovery**: Automatic state recovery from interruptions or failures
- **Tool Integration**: Direct SDK integration replacing complex MCP patterns

### LangGraph Agent Node Implementation

A typical agent in TripSage is implemented as a LangGraph node with service-based architecture:

```python
from tripsage.orchestration.nodes.base import BaseAgentNode
from tripsage.orchestration.state import TravelPlanningState
from tripsage.agents.service_registry import ServiceRegistry
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from typing import Dict, Any

class FlightAgentNode(BaseAgentNode):
    """Specialized flight search and booking agent node."""
    
    def __init__(self, service_registry: ServiceRegistry):
        super().__init__("flight_agent", service_registry)
        
        # Initialize LLM for flight-specific tasks
        self.llm = ChatOpenAI(
            model=settings.agent.model_name,
            temperature=settings.agent.temperature,
        )
    
    def _initialize_tools(self) -> None:
        """Initialize flight-specific services and tools."""
        self.flight_service = self.get_service("flight_service")
        self.memory_service = self.get_optional_service("memory_service")
    
    async def process(self, state: TravelPlanningState) -> TravelPlanningState:
        """Process flight-related requests with full state management."""
        user_message = state["messages"][-1]["content"]
        
        # Extract search parameters using LLM
        search_params = await self._extract_flight_parameters(user_message, state)
        
        if search_params:
            # Perform flight search using service layer
            search_results = await self.flight_service.search_flights(**search_params)
            
            # Update state with results
            state["flight_searches"].append({
                "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
                "parameters": search_params,
                "results": search_results,
                "agent": "flight_agent"
            })
            
            # Generate user-friendly response
            response = await self._generate_flight_response(search_results, search_params)
        else:
            response = await self._handle_general_flight_inquiry(user_message, state)
        
        # Add response to conversation
        state["messages"].append(response)
        return state

# Usage in graph:
# graph.add_node("flight_agent", FlightAgentNode(service_registry))
```

## 3. LangGraph-Based Agent Architecture

### Core Orchestration Graph

The **TripSageOrchestrator** coordinates all specialized agents through a deterministic graph workflow:

```python
# Main orchestration graph structure
graph = StateGraph(TravelPlanningState)
graph.set_entry_point("router")

# Specialized agent nodes
graph.add_node("flight_agent", FlightAgentNode())
graph.add_node("accommodation_agent", AccommodationAgentNode())
graph.add_node("budget_agent", BudgetAgentNode())
graph.add_node("destination_research_agent", DestinationResearchAgentNode())
graph.add_node("itinerary_agent", ItineraryAgentNode())
graph.add_node("memory_update", MemoryUpdateNode())

# Conditional routing based on conversation context
graph.add_conditional_edges("router", route_to_agent, {...})
```

### Specialized Agent Nodes (Production Ready)

  - **Intelligence**: Identifies patterns in user behavior and travel preferences

### Advanced Agent Coordination

#### Intelligent Handoff System

TripSage implements a **rule-based handoff coordinator** that intelligently routes between agents based on conversation context:

```python
from tripsage.orchestration.handoff_coordinator import get_handoff_coordinator, HandoffTrigger

# Automatic agent routing based on conversation state
handoff_coordinator = get_handoff_coordinator()
handoff_result = handoff_coordinator.determine_next_agent(
    current_agent="general_agent",
    state=conversation_state,
    trigger=HandoffTrigger.TASK_COMPLETION
)

if handoff_result:
    next_agent, handoff_context = handoff_result
    # Seamless transition to specialized agent
    state["next_agent"] = next_agent
    state["handoff_context"] = handoff_context.model_dump()
```

#### Handoff Trigger Patterns

1. **Intent-Based Routing**: Routes based on detected user intent (flight search → flight agent)
2. **Task Completion**: Transitions after completing a task (search → booking → itinerary)
3. **Context Accumulation**: Routes when sufficient context is gathered for specialized handling
4. **Error Recovery**: Intelligent fallback to alternative agents when primary agent fails

#### State Preservation Across Handoffs

The LangGraph architecture ensures perfect state continuity:

- **Conversation History**: Full message history preserved across all agent transitions
- **Search Results**: Previous search results remain accessible to subsequent agents
- **User Preferences**: Learned preferences persist throughout the conversation
- **Progress Tracking**: Task completion status maintained across handoffs
- **Error Context**: Error information preserved for intelligent recovery

```python
# Example state preservation during handoff
class TravelPlanningState(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[List[Dict[str, Any]], add_messages]
    user_id: str
    session_id: str
    flight_searches: List[Dict[str, Any]]      # Preserved across agents
    accommodation_searches: List[Dict[str, Any]] # Preserved across agents
    user_preferences: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]   # Learned and preserved
    current_agent: Optional[str]                 # Tracks current handler
    agent_history: List[str]                     # Full handoff history
    handoff_context: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]    # Rich handoff metadata
```

## 4. LangGraph Agent Optimization

### State-Driven Agent Design

LangGraph agents are optimized for stateful, multi-turn conversations with persistent context:

#### Core Optimization Principles

- **State-Aware Processing**: Agents access full conversation state, enabling context-aware responses
- **Memory Integration**: Automatic integration with Neo4j knowledge graph for user preference learning
- **Progressive Information Gathering**: Agents build context across multiple interactions
- **Service-Based Architecture**: Clean separation between agent logic and external service integration
- **Async Performance**: Full async/await support for high-throughput processing

#### Conversation State Management

```python
async def process(self, state: TravelPlanningState) -> TravelPlanningState:
    """Process user request with full state context."""
    
    # Access conversation history
    conversation_history = state["messages"]
    
    # Leverage previous search results
    prior_flights = state.get("flight_searches", [])
    prior_accommodations = state.get("accommodation_searches", [])
    
    # Use learned user preferences
    user_preferences = state.get("user_preferences", {})
    
    # Build context-aware response
    response = await self._generate_contextual_response(
        conversation_history, prior_flights, user_preferences
    )
    
    # Update state with new information
    state["messages"].append(response)
    return state
```

#### Memory-Enhanced Intelligence

Agents leverage the memory bridge for enhanced intelligence:

- **User Preference Learning**: Automatically learns and applies user travel preferences
- **Historical Context**: Access to user's past travel patterns and preferences
- **Conversational Insights**: Extraction and persistence of insights from conversations
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Context-aware suggestions based on user history

### LangGraph Agent Prompt Structure

LangGraph agents use state-aware prompts that leverage conversation context:

```python
# Dynamic prompt generation based on conversation state
async def _generate_contextual_prompt(self, state: TravelPlanningState) -> str:
    """Generate context-aware prompt for the agent."""
    
    user_preferences = state.get("user_preferences", {})
    conversation_history = state["messages"]
    search_history = state.get("flight_searches", [])
    
    prompt = f"""
    You are the Flight Agent for TripSage, specializing in flight search and booking.
    
    CURRENT CONTEXT:
    - User ID: {state['user_id']}
    - Conversation turns: {len(conversation_history)}
    - Previous flight searches: {len(search_history)}
    - Known preferences: {user_preferences.get('airlines', 'None')}
    
    CAPABILITIES:
    - Flight search across multiple airlines and booking platforms
    - Price comparison and trend analysis
    - Route optimization and multi-city planning
    - Integration with user's calendar and preferences
    
    CONVERSATION STATE AWARENESS:
    - Access full conversation history for context
    - Leverage previous search results to refine recommendations
    - Apply learned user preferences automatically
    - Coordinate with other agents (accommodation, budget) for comprehensive planning
    
    RESPONSE GUIDELINES:
    - Use conversation context to avoid asking for previously provided information
    - Reference previous searches when relevant
    - Provide personalized recommendations based on user history
    - Suggest next steps in the travel planning process
    """
    
    return prompt
```

### Performance Optimization Strategies

#### State-Based Efficiency

- **Persistent Context**: Conversation state eliminates need to re-establish context in each interaction
- **Progressive Information Building**: Agents build comprehensive user profiles over multiple conversations
- **Smart Memory Integration**: Automatic retrieval of relevant context from knowledge graph
- **Checkpoint Recovery**: PostgreSQL checkpointing enables conversation resumption from any point

#### Service Integration Optimization

- **Direct SDK Integration**: Bypassed complex MCP patterns in favor of direct service integration
- **Connection Pooling**: PostgreSQL connection pooling for optimal database performance
- **Async Operations**: Full async/await support for high-throughput processing
- **Caching Strategy**: Intelligent caching of search results and user preferences

#### Memory Management

```python
# Memory-enhanced agent processing
class MemoryEnhancedAgent(BaseAgentNode):
    async def process(self, state: TravelPlanningState) -> TravelPlanningState:
        # Hydrate state with user context from memory
        enhanced_state = await self.memory_bridge.hydrate_state(state)
        
        # Process with full context
        response = await self._process_with_context(enhanced_state)
        
        # Extract and persist new insights
        insights = await self._extract_insights(response)
        await self.memory_bridge.persist_insights(insights)
        
        return response
```

## 5. Service Integration Architecture

### Direct SDK Integration (MCP Replacement)

TripSage has migrated from complex MCP patterns to **direct SDK integration** for improved performance and reliability:

#### Service-Based Architecture

```python
from tripsage.agents.service_registry import ServiceRegistry
from tripsage_core.services.business.flight_service import FlightService
from tripsage_core.services.business.accommodation_service import AccommodationService

class FlightAgentNode(BaseAgentNode):
    def __init__(self, service_registry: ServiceRegistry):
        super().__init__("flight_agent", service_registry)
        
    def _initialize_tools(self) -> None:
        # Direct service injection (no MCP complexity)
        self.flight_service = self.get_service("flight_service")
        self.memory_service = self.get_service("memory_service")
        
    async def search_flights(self, search_params: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Direct service call (high performance)
        return await self.flight_service.search_flights(**search_params)
```

#### Service Registry Pattern

Centralized service management eliminates dependency complexity:

```python
# Service registry provides dependency injection
service_registry = ServiceRegistry()
service_registry.register("flight_service", FlightService())
service_registry.register("accommodation_service", AccommodationService())
service_registry.register("memory_service", MemoryService())

# Agents receive services through dependency injection
flight_agent = FlightAgentNode(service_registry)
accom_agent = AccommodationAgentNode(service_registry)
```

#### Performance Benefits

- **Eliminated MCP Overhead**: Direct SDK calls instead of protocol translation
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript/Python type checking
- **Simplified Debugging**: Direct stack traces without protocol abstraction
- **Better Error Handling**: Native exception handling vs. protocol error codes
- **Reduced Latency**: No serialization/deserialization overhead

## 6. Service Integration Patterns

### Service-Based Tool Design

LangGraph agents use service injection for clean, testable tool integration:

#### Service Integration Pattern

```python
from tripsage_core.services.business.flight_service import FlightService
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, field_validator
from typing import Dict, Any, Optional
from datetime import date

class FlightSearchParams(BaseModel):
    origin: str = Field(..., description="Origin airport IATA code")
    destination: str = Field(..., description="Destination airport IATA code")
    departure_date: date = Field(..., description="Departure date")
    return_date: Optional[date] = Field(None, description="Return date for round trips")
    passengers: int = Field(1, ge=1, le=9, description="Number of passengers")
    
    @field_validator("origin", "destination")
    def validate_airport_codes(cls, v: str) -> str:
        return v.upper().strip()

class FlightAgentNode(BaseAgentNode):
    async def search_flights(self, params: FlightSearchParams) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Search for flights using injected flight service."""
        try:
            # Direct service integration (no MCP overhead)
            result = await self.flight_service.search_flights(
                origin=params.origin,
                destination=params.destination,
                departure_date=params.departure_date,
                return_date=params.return_date,
                passengers=params.passengers
            )
            
            return {
                "status": "success",
                "flights": result.get("flights", []),
                "search_metadata": result.get("metadata", {})
            }
            
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Flight search failed: {str(e)}")
            return {
                "status": "error",
                "error": str(e),
                "suggestions": [
                    "Try different dates",
                    "Check airport codes",
                    "Consider nearby airports"
                ]
            }
```

#### Error Handling and Recovery

```python
async def _handle_service_error(self, error: Exception, operation: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Standardized error handling across all service integrations."""
    
    error_response = {
        "status": "error",
        "operation": operation,
        "error_type": type(error).__name__,
        "message": str(error),
        "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat()
    }
    
    # Add context-specific suggestions
    if "timeout" in str(error).lower():
        error_response["suggestions"] = ["Service is busy, please try again"]
    elif "not found" in str(error).lower():
        error_response["suggestions"] = ["Check search parameters", "Try broader criteria"]
    
    return error_response
```

## 7. Advanced Error Handling and Recovery

### LangGraph Error Recovery System

TripSage implements sophisticated error handling with automatic recovery mechanisms:

#### Error Recovery Node

```python
from tripsage.orchestration.nodes.error_recovery import ErrorRecoveryNode

class ErrorRecoveryNode(BaseAgentNode):
    """Handles errors and implements recovery strategies."""
    
    async def process(self, state: TravelPlanningState) -> TravelPlanningState:
        error_count = state.get("error_count", 0)
        last_error = state.get("last_error", "")
        current_agent = state.get("current_agent", "")
        
        # Implement recovery strategies
        if error_count < 3:
            recovery_strategy = await self._determine_recovery_strategy(
                last_error, current_agent, state
            )
            
            if recovery_strategy == "retry_with_different_agent":
                alternative_agent = await self._find_alternative_agent(current_agent)
                state["current_agent"] = alternative_agent
                state["recovery_action"] = "agent_fallback"
                
            elif recovery_strategy == "retry_with_simplified_request":
                state["simplified_request"] = await self._simplify_request(state)
                state["recovery_action"] = "request_simplification"
                
        return state
```

#### Graceful Degradation Patterns

```python
async def _handle_service_degradation(self, service_name: str, error: Exception) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Implement graceful degradation when services are unavailable."""
    
    fallback_strategies = {
        "flight_service": {
            "fallback": "cached_results",
            "message": "Using recent flight data due to service issues"
        },
        "accommodation_service": {
            "fallback": "general_recommendations",
            "message": "Providing general accommodation suggestions"
        },
        "memory_service": {
            "fallback": "session_only",
            "message": "Using session memory only"
        }
    }
    
    strategy = fallback_strategies.get(service_name, {})
    
    return {
        "status": "degraded",
        "fallback_active": True,
        "fallback_strategy": strategy.get("fallback"),
        "user_message": strategy.get("message"),
        "original_error": str(error)
    }
```

#### Input Validation and Safety

```python
class InputValidationNode(BaseAgentNode):
    """Validates user input for safety and compliance."""
    
    async def validate_user_input(self, message: str, state: TravelPlanningState) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        validation_results = {
            "is_safe": True,
            "contains_pii": False,
            "content_appropriate": True,
            "suggestions": []
        }
        
        # PII detection
        if await self._detect_pii(message):
            validation_results["contains_pii"] = True
            validation_results["is_safe"] = False
            validation_results["suggestions"].append(
                "Please avoid sharing personal information like credit card numbers"
            )
        
        # Content appropriateness
        if not await self._check_content_appropriateness(message):
            validation_results["content_appropriate"] = False
            validation_results["is_safe"] = False
            validation_results["suggestions"].append(
                "Please keep messages related to travel planning"
            )
        
        return validation_results
```

## 8. Monitoring and Observability

### LangGraph State Monitoring

LangGraph provides built-in monitoring and observability for agent execution:

#### State Tracking and Debugging

```python
from tripsage_core.utils.logging_utils import get_logger
from langgraph.checkpoint import BaseCheckpointSaver

logger = get_logger(__name__)

class TripSageOrchestrator:
    async def process_message(self, user_id: str, message: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Process message with comprehensive monitoring."""
        
        # Log conversation start
        logger.info(f"Starting conversation processing for user {user_id}")
        
        try:
            # Process through graph with state tracking
            config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": session_id}}
            result = await self.compiled_graph.ainvoke(initial_state, config=config)
            
            # Log successful completion
            logger.info(
                f"Conversation completed successfully",
                extra={
                    "user_id": user_id,
                    "session_id": session_id,
                    "agent_used": result.get("current_agent"),
                    "message_count": len(result["messages"]),
                    "search_count": len(result.get("flight_searches", []))
                }
            )
            
            return result
            
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(
                f"Conversation processing failed: {str(e)}",
                extra={"user_id": user_id, "error_type": type(e).__name__},
                exc_info=True
            )
            raise
```

#### Performance Metrics

```python
import time
from typing import Dict, Any

class PerformanceMonitor:
    """Monitor agent performance and response times."""
    
    async def track_agent_performance(self, agent_name: str, operation: str):
        """Context manager for tracking agent operation performance."""
        start_time = time.time()
        
        try:
            yield
            
        finally:
            duration = time.time() - start_time
            
            logger.info(
                f"Agent operation completed",

#### State Persistence Monitoring

```python
from tripsage.orchestration.checkpoint_manager import get_checkpoint_manager

class StateMonitor:
    """Monitor state persistence and checkpoint operations."""
    
    async def monitor_checkpoint_operations(self, session_id: str):
        """Monitor state persistence health."""
        
        try:
            checkpoint_manager = get_checkpoint_manager()
            
            # Test checkpoint write performance
            start_time = time.time()
            await checkpoint_manager.test_checkpoint_write(session_id)
            write_duration = time.time() - start_time
            
            # Test checkpoint read performance
            start_time = time.time()
            await checkpoint_manager.test_checkpoint_read(session_id)
            read_duration = time.time() - start_time
            
            logger.info(
                "Checkpoint performance check",
                extra={
                    "session_id": session_id,
                    "write_duration_ms": round(write_duration * 1000, 2),

                }
            )
            
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Checkpoint monitoring failed: {str(e)}")
```

## 9. Testing LangGraph Agents

LangGraph agents are tested using state-based testing patterns with service mocking:

### Agent Node Testing

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import AsyncMock, MagicMock
from tripsage.orchestration.nodes.flight_agent import FlightAgentNode
from tripsage.orchestration.state import TravelPlanningState, create_initial_state
from tripsage.agents.service_registry import ServiceRegistry

@pytest.fixture
def mock_service_registry():
    """Create mock service registry for testing."""
    registry = MagicMock(spec=ServiceRegistry)
    
    # Mock flight service
    mock_flight_service = AsyncMock()
    mock_flight_service.search_flights.return_value = {
        "status": "success",
        "flights": [
            {
                "airline": "United",
                "flight_number": "UA123",
                "price": 299.99,
                "duration": "5h 30m"
            }
        ]
    }
    
    registry.get_service.return_value = mock_flight_service
    registry.get_optional_service.return_value = None
    
    return registry

@pytest.fixture
def flight_agent_node(mock_service_registry):
    """Create flight agent node with mocked services."""
    return FlightAgentNode(mock_service_registry)

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_flight_search_success(flight_agent_node):
    """Test successful flight search with state management."""
    
    # Create initial state
    initial_state = create_initial_state(
        user_id="test_user",
        message="Find flights from SFO to JFK on 2024-03-15"
    )
    
    # Process the request
    result_state = await flight_agent_node.process(initial_state)
    
    # Verify state updates
    assert len(result_state["flight_searches"]) == 1
    assert result_state["flight_searches"][0]["agent"] == "flight_agent"
    
    # Verify response message added
    assert len(result_state["messages"]) == 2  # Original + response
    response_message = result_state["messages"][-1]
    assert response_message["role"] == "assistant"
    assert "United" in response_message["content"]
    assert "$299.99" in response_message["content"]

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_flight_search_error_handling(flight_agent_node, mock_service_registry):
    """Test error handling in flight search."""
    
    # Configure service to return error
    mock_flight_service = mock_service_registry.get_service.return_value
    mock_flight_service.search_flights.side_effect = Exception("API timeout")
    
    initial_state = create_initial_state(
        user_id="test_user",
        message="Find flights from SFO to JFK"
    )
    
    result_state = await flight_agent_node.process(initial_state)
    
    # Verify error handling
    response_message = result_state["messages"][-1]
    assert "apologize" in response_message["content"].lower()
    assert "issue" in response_message["content"].lower()
```

### Integration Testing

```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_full_orchestration_flow():
    """Test complete orchestration flow with multiple agents."""
    
    # Initialize orchestrator with test configuration
    orchestrator = TripSageOrchestrator(
        checkpointer=MemorySaver(),  # Use memory saver for tests
        config=test_config
    )
    
    await orchestrator.initialize()
    
    # Process user message
    result = await orchestrator.process_message(
        user_id="test_user",
        message="Help me plan a trip to Paris for 2 people from March 15-22"
    )
    
    # Verify response structure
    assert "response" in result
    assert "session_id" in result
    assert "agent_used" in result
    assert result["response"] is not None
    
    # Verify session state
    session_state = await orchestrator.get_session_state(result["session_id"])
    assert session_state is not None
    assert session_state["user_id"] == "test_user"
```

### Performance Testing

```python
import time

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_agent_response_time():
    """Test agent response time performance."""
    
    flight_agent = FlightAgentNode(mock_service_registry)
    
    start_time = time.time()
    
    state = create_initial_state("test_user", "Find flights SFO to JFK")
    result = await flight_agent.process(state)
    
    duration = time.time() - start_time
    
    # Agent should respond within 5 seconds
    assert duration < 5.0
    assert result is not None
```

## 10. Legacy Agent Handoff Patterns (Pre-LangGraph)

> **Note**: This section documents the historical agent handoff patterns used before the LangGraph migration. It is preserved for reference but the current system uses LangGraph-based orchestration as described in the earlier sections.

### Historical Handoff Architecture

Before LangGraph integration, TripSage used OpenAI Agents SDK handoff patterns. These patterns are documented here for historical context and potential reference for alternative implementations.

#### Pattern 1: Triage with Specialized Agents

The legacy pattern involved a main triage agent that orchestrated handoffs to domain-specific agents:

```plaintext
User → TravelAgent (Triage) → Specialized Agents (Flight, Accommodation, Itinerary, etc.)
```

This pattern enabled:
- Clear separation of responsibilities
- Focused expertise in specialized domains
- Simplified maintenance and updates
- Dynamic scaling of capabilities

#### Pattern 2: Dynamic Routing Based on Intent

Advanced handoffs used intent detection to dynamically determine the appropriate specialist:

```plaintext
User → Intent Analyzer → Appropriate Specialist → Further Sub-specialists if needed
```

### Legacy Handoff Implementation

```python
# Historical implementation (pre-LangGraph)
from agents import Agent

# Create specialized agents
flight_agent = Agent(name="Flight Agent", instructions="You are a flight specialist...")
accommodation_agent = Agent(name="Accommodation Agent", instructions="You are an accommodation specialist...")

# Create main travel agent with handoffs
travel_agent = Agent(
    name="Travel Agent",
    instructions="""You are a travel planning assistant.
    When users ask about flights, use the transfer_to_flight_agent tool.
    When users ask about accommodations, use the transfer_to_accommodation_agent tool.
    """,
    handoffs=[flight_agent, accommodation_agent]
)
```

### Migration to LangGraph

The current system replaced this pattern with LangGraph-based orchestration for:
- **Better State Management**: Persistent conversation state across agent transitions
- **Graph-Based Workflows**: Deterministic execution flows with conditional branching
- **PostgreSQL Checkpointing**: Production-ready state persistence and recovery
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery and graceful degradation
- **Performance Optimization**: Async operations and connection pooling

For current handoff implementation, refer to the LangGraph orchestration sections above.
