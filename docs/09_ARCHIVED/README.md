## üìÅ Archive Contents

### **Migration Planning** (`migration_planning/`)
*Completed migration planning documents from 2024-2025 architectural transformation*

- **API_CONSOLIDATION_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md** - Executive summary of API consolidation plan
- **API_CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md** - Detailed API consolidation implementation plan
- **API_MIGRATION_TESTING_STRATEGY.md** - Testing strategy for API migration
- **AUTHENTICATION_MIGRATION_PLAN.md** - Authentication system migration plan
- **ROUTER_MIGRATION_EXAMPLE.md** - Example router migration patterns

**Historical Context**: These documents guided the successful consolidation of TripSage's dual API architecture into a unified modern implementation, completed in May 2025.

### **Deprecated Features** (`deprecated_features/`)
*Documentation for features that have been removed or replaced*

- **OLD_MCP_SERVERS.md** - Documentation for deprecated MCP server implementations
- **LEGACY_API_ENDPOINTS.md** - Deprecated API endpoints and their replacements

**Deprecation Timeline**: Most MCP servers were migrated to direct SDK integrations during the v2.0 architecture upgrade for improved performance and maintainability.

### **Legacy Architecture** (`legacy_architecture/`)
*Previous architecture documentation for reference and historical context*

- **DUAL_STORAGE_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Documentation of the deprecated Neon + Supabase dual database setup
- **KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_GUIDE.md** - Neo4j knowledge graph implementation (replaced by Mem0)

**Architecture Evolution**: These represent the complex multi-service architecture that was simplified in the v2.0 transformation, achieving 80% cost reduction and 50-70% performance improvement.

### **Prompting Guides** (`prompting_guides/`)
*Archived AI prompting and interaction documentation*

- **GPT-4.1_PROMPTING_ESSENTIALS.md** - Essential prompting techniques for GPT-4.1
- **GPT-4.1_PROMPTING_GUIDE.md** - Comprehensive prompting guide for GPT-4.1

**Status**: These guides were created for specific AI model versions and prompting approaches. Current AI interaction patterns are documented in the main [Features & Integrations](../05_FEATURES_AND_INTEGRATIONS/) section.

## üîç Access Policy
