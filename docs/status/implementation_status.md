## Web Crawling Architecture

The Web Crawling MCP Server will utilize a tiered architecture with three key components:

1. **Crawl4AI (Primary)**: Self-hosted web crawling engine providing 10Ã— throughput improvements
   - Batch processing for parallel extractions
   - Travel-specific content extraction templates
   - Advanced caching with content-aware TTL

2. **Firecrawl API (Secondary)**: Existing MCP for specialized AI-optimized extractions
   - Deep research capabilities
   - Semantic extraction features

3. **Enhanced Playwright (Tertiary)**: Custom automation framework for dynamic content
   - Interactive site navigation
   - Authentication handling
   - Form submission and event extraction

This architecture represents an upgrade from the previous Firecrawl-first approach, based on comprehensive evaluation showing Crawl4AI's superior performance for travel-specific content extraction.

## Conclusion

The TripSage implementation is in the early planning and initial implementation phase. The core architecture has been consolidated into a single comprehensive strategy document (`tripsage_optimization_strategy.md`), providing a clear roadmap for development. The immediate focus is on setting up the Weather and Web Crawling MCP servers using Python FastMCP 2.0, followed by a phased implementation of the remaining MCP servers and agent components.

The system will follow a hybrid database approach with Supabase for production and Neon for development, complemented by Neo4j for knowledge graph capabilities. Vector search functionality via Qdrant is scheduled for post-MVP implementation.

Progress is tracked in GitHub issues, with detailed implementation plans and timelines as outlined in the optimization strategy document.
