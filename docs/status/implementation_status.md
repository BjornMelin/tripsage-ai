## Web Crawling Architecture

The Web Crawling MCP Server will utilize a tiered architecture with three key components:

1. **Crawl4AI (Primary)**: Self-hosted web crawling engine providing 10Ã— throughput improvements

   - Batch processing for parallel extractions
   - Travel-specific content extraction templates
   - Advanced caching with content-aware TTL

2. **Firecrawl API (Secondary)**: Existing MCP for specialized AI-optimized extractions

   - Deep research capabilities
   - Semantic extraction features

3. **Enhanced Playwright with Python (Tertiary)**: Custom automation framework for dynamic content
   - Interactive site navigation using native Python bindings
   - Authentication handling with browser context management
   - Form submission and event extraction
   - Superior performance (35% faster than alternatives)
   - Cross-browser support (Chrome, Firefox, WebKit)

This architecture represents an upgrade from the previous Firecrawl-first approach, based on comprehensive evaluation showing Crawl4AI's superior performance for travel-specific content extraction.

## Browser Automation Architecture

The Browser Automation MCP Server is implemented using Playwright with Python, selected for its superior performance, Python integration, and compatibility with FastMCP 2.0:

1. **Playwright with Python (Primary)**: Modern browser automation framework

   - 35% faster than alternatives
   - Cross-browser support (Chrome, Firefox, WebKit)
   - Excellent Python integration
   - Full compatibility with OpenAI Agents SDK

2. **Browser Context Management**: Efficient resource utilization

   - Session-based browser contexts
   - Pooled resources to reduce startup time
   - Automatic cleanup to prevent memory leaks

3. **Travel-Specific Functions**: Purpose-built for travel needs

   - Flight status checking
   - Booking verification (âœ… Complete with Pydantic v2 validation)
   - Check-in automation
   - Price monitoring

4. **Data Validation**: Comprehensive Pydantic v2 implementation
   - Field validators with @field_validator
   - Model validators with @model_validator
   - Request/response validation with ConfigDict
   - Function validation with @validate_call
   - Strong typing with Annotated and custom validators

This architecture represents a significant upgrade from the previously planned Browser-use implementation, eliminating the 100-minute monthly limitation and providing better integration with the Python-based backend.

## Conclusion

The TripSage implementation has made significant progress with all key MCP server components now complete. We've successfully integrated with multiple official MCP servers (Time MCP, Neo4j Memory MCP, Google Maps MCP, Airbnb MCP) and created robust client implementations with proper error handling and caching strategies.

Recent completions include:

1. Integrating the official Time MCP server for time and timezone operations
2. Implementing the ravinahp/flights-mcp server for flight search via Duffel API
3. Setting up the OpenBnB Airbnb MCP for accommodation search
4. Implementing a dual storage strategy with Supabase and Neo4j Memory MCP
5. Integrating Crawl4AI and Firecrawl for advanced web crawling
6. Adopting the Google Maps MCP for location data and routing
7. Centralizing configuration with Pydantic Settings
8. Creating deployment scripts for MCP servers including start/stop functionality
9. Standardizing all MCP clients with Pydantic v2 validation patterns
10. Implementing comprehensive test suite for all MCP clients
11. Creating MockMCPClient pattern for reliable testing without external dependencies

The system follows a hybrid database approach with Supabase for production and Neon for development, complemented by Neo4j for knowledge graph capabilities. Vector search functionality via Qdrant is scheduled for post-MVP implementation.

The immediate focus is now on implementing the OpenAI Agents SDK integration (#28), improving the caching strategy (#38), and enhancing web search capabilities (#37). These will be followed by database operations via MCP servers (#22, #23) and calendar integration (#25).

The MCP client refactoring and test implementation (PR #53) adds significant reliability and maintainability to the codebase with standardized Pydantic v2 validation patterns across all MCP clients. This work has established a unified pattern for implementing future MCP clients (like Neon and Supabase) with proper validation and error handling.

Progress continues to be tracked in GitHub issues, with detailed implementation plans and timelines as outlined in the optimization strategy document.
