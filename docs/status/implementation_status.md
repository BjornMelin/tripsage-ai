## Web Crawling Architecture

The Web Crawling MCP Server will utilize a tiered architecture with three key components:

1. **Crawl4AI (Primary)**: Self-hosted web crawling engine providing 10Ã— throughput improvements

   - Batch processing for parallel extractions
   - Travel-specific content extraction templates
   - Advanced caching with content-aware TTL

2. **Firecrawl API (Secondary)**: Existing MCP for specialized AI-optimized extractions

   - Deep research capabilities
   - Semantic extraction features

3. **Enhanced Playwright with Python (Tertiary)**: Custom automation framework for dynamic content
   - Interactive site navigation using native Python bindings
   - Authentication handling with browser context management
   - Form submission and event extraction
   - Superior performance (35% faster than alternatives)
   - Cross-browser support (Chrome, Firefox, WebKit)

This architecture represents an upgrade from the previous Firecrawl-first approach, based on comprehensive evaluation showing Crawl4AI's superior performance for travel-specific content extraction.

## Browser Automation Architecture

The Browser Automation MCP Server will be implemented using Playwright with Python, selected for its superior performance, Python integration, and compatibility with FastMCP 2.0:

1. **Playwright with Python (Primary)**: Modern browser automation framework

   - 35% faster than alternatives
   - Cross-browser support (Chrome, Firefox, WebKit)
   - Excellent Python integration
   - Full compatibility with OpenAI Agents SDK

2. **Browser Context Management**: Efficient resource utilization

   - Session-based browser contexts
   - Pooled resources to reduce startup time
   - Automatic cleanup to prevent memory leaks

3. **Travel-Specific Functions**: Purpose-built for travel needs
   - Flight status checking
   - Booking verification
   - Check-in automation
   - Price monitoring

This architecture represents a significant upgrade from the previously planned Browser-use implementation, eliminating the 100-minute monthly limitation and providing better integration with the Python-based backend.

## Conclusion

The TripSage implementation is in the early planning and initial implementation phase. The core architecture has been consolidated into a single comprehensive strategy document (`tripsage_optimization_strategy.md`), providing a clear roadmap for development.

Recent architecture reviews have resulted in two key changes:

1. Shifting from a Firecrawl-first to a Crawl4AI-first approach for web crawling
2. Replacing Browser-use with Playwright+Python for browser automation

The immediate focus is on setting up the Weather, Web Crawling, and Browser Automation MCP servers using Python FastMCP 2.0, followed by a phased implementation of the remaining MCP servers and agent components.

The system will follow a hybrid database approach with Supabase for production and Neon for development, complemented by Neo4j for knowledge graph capabilities. Vector search functionality via Qdrant is scheduled for post-MVP implementation.

Progress is tracked in GitHub issues, with detailed implementation plans and timelines as outlined in the optimization strategy document.
