# TripSage Implementation Status

**Date**: May 9, 2025  
**Project**: TripSage AI Travel Planning System  
**Status**: Planning Phase

## Overview

This document tracks the current implementation status of the TripSage travel planning system, with a focus on MCP server integration, architecture decisions, and implementation progress.

## Completed Items

### Documentation & Planning

- âœ… Created comprehensive MCP technology evaluation document (`/docs/optimization/mcp_technology_selection.md`)
- âœ… Developed consolidated MCP implementation strategy (`/docs/optimization/mcp_consolidated_strategy.md`)
- âœ… Standardized on Python FastMCP 2.0 for MCP server implementation
- âœ… Decision to use official MCP implementations where available (Time MCP, Neo4j Memory MCP)
- âœ… Selected core technology stack:
  - Python FastMCP 2.0 for MCP servers
  - Neo4j with official `mcp-neo4j-memory` for knowledge graph
  - Redis for multi-level caching
  - Supabase for relational data storage
  - OpenAPI integration for external travel APIs
- âœ… Deferred Qdrant vector database integration to post-MVP phase
- âœ… Created GitHub issue (#2) for post-MVP Qdrant integration with detailed implementation plan

### Repository Organization

- âœ… Archived duplicate/outdated optimization and integration documents
- âœ… Set up project directory structure for MCP server implementation
- âœ… Organized documentation in logical sections (optimization, integration, status)

## In Progress

- ðŸ”„ Setting up development environment for Python FastMCP 2.0
- ðŸ”„ Initial skeleton implementation of Weather MCP server
- ðŸ”„ OpenWeatherMap API integration design

## Next Steps

### Immediate Focus (1-2 Weeks)

1. Initialize Python FastMCP 2.0 development environment

   - Install dependencies and setup tooling
   - Create project scaffolding for MCP servers
   - Set up testing framework

2. Implement Weather MCP Server

   - Develop OpenWeatherMap API integration
   - Create MCP tools for current conditions, forecasts, and recommendations
   - Implement caching strategy with Redis
   - Add error handling and fallback mechanisms

3. Implement Web Crawling MCP Server
   - Set up Firecrawl API integration
   - Create tools for destination research and content extraction
   - Implement structured data processing

### Short-Term (3-4 Weeks)

1. Implement Flight MCP Server

   - Integrate with Duffel API via OpenAPI specification
   - Develop flight search and booking capabilities
   - Set up price tracking and history

2. Implement Accommodation MCP Server
   - Create integration with OpenBnB and Apify Booking.com
   - Develop unified accommodation search and comparison

### Medium-Term (5-6 Weeks)

1. Implement Calendar MCP Server

   - Set up Google Calendar API integration
   - Develop OAuth flow for user authorization
   - Create tools for travel itinerary management

2. Implement Memory MCP Server
   - Integrate with Neo4j via official MCP implementation
   - Develop knowledge graph for travel entities and relationships
   - Create tools for knowledge storage and retrieval

### Long-Term (7-8 Weeks)

1. Finalize MVP Implementation

   - Complete end-to-end testing
   - Optimize performance
   - Document API and usage patterns

2. Prepare for Qdrant Integration (Post-MVP)
   - Research embedding models for travel data
   - Design vector storage schema
   - Prepare integration architecture

## Risk Assessment

| Risk                                       | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation                                  |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Python FastMCP 2.0 is still evolving       | Medium | Medium     | Pin to stable version, monitor for changes  |
| External API rate limitations              | High   | High       | Implement robust caching and rate limiting  |
| Integration complexity between MCP servers | Medium | Medium     | Clear interfaces, comprehensive testing     |
| Neo4j knowledge graph scaling              | Medium | Low        | Design for scalability, monitor performance |
| Environment variable management for APIs   | Medium | Low        | Implement secure credential storage         |

## Resource Requirements

- **Development Environment**: Python 3.10+, Node.js 18+
- **External Services**: OpenWeatherMap API, Duffel API, Google Calendar API
- **Infrastructure**: Redis instance, Neo4j database, Supabase project
- **Post-MVP**: Qdrant instance (for vector search)

## Conclusion

The TripSage implementation is in the early planning and initial implementation phase. The core architecture decisions have been made, with a focus on Python FastMCP 2.0 for MCP server implementation. The immediate next steps involve setting up the development environment and implementing the first two MCP servers (Weather and Web Crawling) while following the established implementation strategy.

Progress is tracked in GitHub issues, with vector search capabilities (Qdrant) scheduled for post-MVP integration as detailed in issue #2.
