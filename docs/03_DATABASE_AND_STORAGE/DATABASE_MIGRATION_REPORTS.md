# Database Migration Reports

This document consolidates reports on significant database migration efforts within the TripSage project.

## Report 1: Migration from `src/db/` to MCP-Based Approach

**Date of Completion**: Approximately January 16, 2025 (as per original report)  
**Status**: COMPLETE ✅

### 1.1. Summary

This migration involved transitioning the database access layer from a direct connection and repository pattern (previously located in the `src/db/` directory) to a new architecture centered around Model Context Protocol (MCP) abstractions. The primary goal was to decouple application logic from direct database dependencies, improve testability, and standardize data access patterns.

### 1.2. What Was Migrated

#### Core Business Models

- ✅ **User Model** (`src/db/models/user.py` → `tripsage/models/db/user.py`):
  - Preserved all business logic and validation rules.
  - Maintained preference management functionality.
  - Updated to Pydantic V2 patterns.
- ✅ **Trip Model** (`src/db/models/trip.py` → `tripsage/models/db/trip.py`):
  - Migrated enums (e.g., `TripStatus`, `Currency`).
  - Preserved business logic (e.g., duration calculation).
  - Added comprehensive validation.
- ❌ **Flight Model**:
  - Not directly migrated to the new database model structure.
  - Flight operations are now primarily handled via the Flights MCP.
  - A `Flight` model exists in `tripsage/models/flight.py` for MCP integration and API responses.

#### Database Operations

All database operations were refactored to be performed through MCP tools:

- ✅ **SQL Operations (via Supabase MCP / Neon MCP)**:

  - Generic CRUD operations now available via standardized tools.
  - Domain-specific operations re-implemented or mapped to MCP tools:
    - `find_user_by_email`
    - `find_users_by_name_pattern`
    - `update_user_preferences`
    - `create_trip`
    - `find_trips_by_user`
    - `find_trips_by_destination`
    - `find_active_trips_by_date_range`
    - `execute_sql` (for raw SQL).

- ✅ **Neo4j Graph Operations (via Memory MCP)**:
  - Knowledge graph operations now accessed through Memory MCP tools:
    - `find_destinations_by_country`
    - `find_nearby_destinations`
    - `find_popular_destinations`
    - `search_destination_activities`
    - `create_trip_entities`
    - `find_accommodations_in_destination`.

#### Migration System Infrastructure

- ✅ **SQL Migrations Runner**:
  - Updated or replaced the old `src/db/migrations.py`.
  - Uses `execute_sql` tool (for Supabase/Neon) to apply migration scripts.
- ✅ **Neo4j Migrations Runner**:
  - Introduced or updated scripts for Neo4j schema setup.
  - Applies constraints, creates indexes, etc.
- ✅ **Unified Migration Scripting**:
  - A unified way to trigger migrations for both database types, possibly via a CLI.
- ✅ **Database Initialization Scripts**:
  - `src/db/initialize.py` refactored to `tripsage/db/initialize.py`.
  - Uses MCP clients for database connections and verifying schema.

### 1.3. Missing Operations (Post-Migration, Low to Medium Priority)

The following operations from the old `src/db/` layer were identified as not immediately migrated:

#### User Operations (Priority: Medium)

- ❌ `set_admin_status`
- ❌ `set_disabled_status`
- ❌ `update_password`
- ❌ `get_admins`

#### Trip Operations (Priority: Medium)

- ❌ `get_upcoming_trips`

#### Flight Operations (Priority: High, if database persistence beyond MCP is needed)

- ❌ `find_flights_by_trip_id`
- ❌ `find_flights_by_route`
- ❌ `find_flights_by_date_range`
- ❌ `update_flight_booking_status`
- ❌ `get_flight_statistics`

### 1.4. Architectural Changes and Benefits

**Old Architecture (`src/db/`)**:

- Direct database clients and repository pattern.
- Models tightly coupled with DB specifics.

**New Architecture (MCP-based)**:

- **Models**: Pydantic-based, focusing on data structure/validation.
- **Tools**: Database operations exposed as MCP tools.
- **Migrations**: MCP-based or script-based runners.
- **MCP Abstraction Layer**: Manages connections/interactions with DB MCPs.

**Key Benefits**:

1. **Separation of Concerns**.
2. **Standardized Error Handling**.
3. **Improved Testability**.
4. **Scalability and Flexibility**.
5. **Enhanced Type Safety**.

### 1.5. Files Deleted

All files/subdirectories in the old `src/db/` path were removed after migration or deemed obsolete, including:

- `src/db/client.py`
- `src/db/config.py`
- `src/db/exceptions.py`
- `src/db/factory.py`
- `src/db/initialize.py`
- `src/db/migrations.py`
- `src/db/providers.py`
- `src/db/query_builder.py`
- `src/db/models/`
- `src/db/repositories/`
- `src/db/neo4j/`

### 1.6. Testing Post-Migration

A comprehensive test suite was created:

- Unit tests for MCP tools.
- Model validation tests for Pydantic schemas.
- Integration tests verifying end-to-end data flow.

### 1.7. Conclusion of Report 1

The migration to an MCP-based approach is complete and has modernized TripSage's data access layer. The old `src/db/` directory and contents have been removed. Missing operations are documented for future implementation.
