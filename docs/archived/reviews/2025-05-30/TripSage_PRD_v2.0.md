## Technology Implementation Details

### LangGraph Integration Architecture

#### **Agent Coordination Graph**
```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent
from langgraph_supervisor import create_supervisor

# Define specialized travel agents
flight_agent = create_react_agent(
    model="openai:gpt-4o",
    tools=[search_flights, book_flight, price_alert],
    prompt="You are an expert flight booking assistant...",
    name="flight_agent"
)

accommodation_agent = create_react_agent(
    model="anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet",
    tools=[search_hotels, search_airbnb, book_accommodation],
    prompt="You are an expert accommodation booking assistant...",
    name="accommodation_agent"
)

budget_agent = create_react_agent(
    model="openai:gpt-4o",
    tools=[optimize_budget, price_compare, alert_setup],
    prompt="You are a budget optimization specialist...",
    name="budget_agent"
)

# Create supervisor for agent coordination
trip_planning_supervisor = create_supervisor(
    agents=[flight_agent, accommodation_agent, budget_agent],
    model=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o"),
    prompt="""
    You manage a team of travel planning specialists. For each user request:
    1. Analyze the travel planning needs
    2. Assign appropriate agents to handle specific aspects
    3. Coordinate between agents to create cohesive plans
    4. Ensure budget constraints are respected
    5. Optimize for user preferences and real-time conditions
    """
).compile()
```

#### **Advanced Multi-Agent Workflows**
```python
# Complex trip planning with parallel execution
@entrypoint()
async def plan_complex_trip(request: TravelRequest) -> TripPlan:
    # Phase 1: Parallel research
    research_tasks = [
        research_destinations(request.interests),
        analyze_budget_constraints(request.budget),
        check_weather_patterns(request.dates),
        review_user_history(request.user_id)
    ]
    research_results = await asyncio.gather(*research_tasks)
    
    # Phase 2: Agent coordination with state management
    coordinator_state = {
        "destinations": research_results[0],
        "budget": research_results[1], 
        "weather": research_results[2],
        "user_preferences": research_results[3],
        "constraints": request.constraints
    }
    
    # Phase 3: Supervisor orchestrates specialized agents
    trip_plan = await trip_planning_supervisor.stream(
        {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": request.natural_language}]},
        config={"configurable": {"state": coordinator_state}}
    )
    
    return trip_plan
```

### Real-time Architecture Implementation

#### **WebSocket State Synchronization**
```typescript
// Real-time collaborative planning
interface CollaborativeState {
  tripId: string;
  participants: Participant[];
  sharedItinerary: Itinerary;
  agentStatus: AgentStatus[];
  lockState: LockState;
}

class RealTimePlanningManager {
  private ws: WebSocket;
  private state: CollaborativeState;
  private stateHistory: StateSnapshot[];
  
  async synchronizeState(update: StateUpdate): Promise<void> {
    // Optimistic update with conflict resolution
    const proposedState = this.applyUpdate(this.state, update);
    
    // Validate update doesn't conflict with recent changes
    if (this.hasConflict(proposedState, this.stateHistory)) {
      await this.resolveConflict(update, this.stateHistory);
    }
    
    // Broadcast validated update to all participants
    this.broadcastUpdate(proposedState);
    
    // Persist state change
    await this.persistState(proposedState);
  }
  
  private resolveConflict(update: StateUpdate, history: StateSnapshot[]): Promise<StateUpdate> {
    // Intelligent conflict resolution using operational transforms
    return this.operationalTransform.resolve(update, history);
  }
}
```

#### **Agent Status Broadcasting**
```python
# Real-time agent status updates
class AgentStatusBroadcaster:
    def __init__(self, websocket_manager: WebSocketManager):
        self.ws_manager = websocket_manager
        self.active_agents = {}
    
    async def broadcast_agent_status(self, trip_id: str, agent_name: str, status: AgentStatus):
        message = {
            "type": "agent_status_update",
            "trip_id": trip_id,
            "agent": agent_name,
            "status": status.status,
            "progress": status.progress,
            "message": status.current_task,
            "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
        }
        
        # Broadcast to all trip participants
        await self.ws_manager.broadcast_to_trip(trip_id, message)
        
        # Update agent tracking
        self.active_agents[f"{trip_id}:{agent_name}"] = status
```

### Performance Optimization Implementation

#### **Advanced Caching Strategy**
```python
# Multi-layer caching with intelligent invalidation
class TravelDataCache:
    def __init__(self):
        self.dragonfly = DragonflyDB()  # L1: Real-time cache
        self.postgres = PostgreSQL()    # L2: Persistent cache
        self.mem0 = Mem0Client()       # L3: Semantic cache
    
    async def get_cached_recommendation(self, user_id: str, query: TravelQuery) -> Optional[Recommendation]:
        # L1: Check real-time cache (sub-10ms)
        cache_key = self.generate_cache_key(user_id, query)
        result = await self.dragonfly.get(cache_key)
        if result:
            return Recommendation.parse_obj(result)
        
        # L2: Check semantic similarity in Mem0 (sub-100ms)
        similar_queries = await self.mem0.search_memories(
            user_id=user_id,
            query=query.to_semantic_string(),
            similarity_threshold=0.85
        )
        
        if similar_queries:
            # Adapt similar recommendation to current query
            adapted = await self.adapt_recommendation(similar_queries[0], query)
            await self.dragonfly.set(cache_key, adapted.dict(), ttl=3600)
            return adapted
        
        return None
    
    async def invalidate_on_price_change(self, price_update: PriceUpdate):
        # Intelligent cache invalidation based on price sensitivity
        affected_keys = await self.find_price_sensitive_keys(price_update)
        await self.dragonfly.delete_many(affected_keys)
```

#### **Database Query Optimization**
```sql
-- Optimized vector similarity search with pgvectorscale
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_destinations_embedding_cosine 
ON destinations USING diskann (embedding vector_cosine_ops)
WITH (lists = 1000);

-- Optimized budget constraint query
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_accommodations_budget_location
ON accommodations (price_per_night, location_id) 
WHERE is_available = true;

-- Materialized view for popular destination combinations
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW popular_destination_combinations AS
SELECT 
    origin_city,
    destination_city,
    travel_month,
    avg_price,
    booking_count,
    user_satisfaction_score
FROM trip_analytics 
WHERE booking_count > 100
GROUP BY origin_city, destination_city, travel_month;
```
