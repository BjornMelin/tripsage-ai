# MCP Technology Selection for TripSage

This document presents an analysis of MCP server technologies and associated databases for the TripSage travel planning system, comparing them with the current plan and providing recommendations for optimal implementation.

## Executive Summary

After evaluating the current TripSage architecture against available MCP technologies, we recommend:

1. **Standardizing on Python FastMCP 2.0** for all custom MCP servers
2. **Using official MCP implementations** for Time MCP and Neo4j integration
3. **Planning for Qdrant vector database** as a future enhancement after MVP completion
4. **Leveraging OpenAPI integration** for rapid external API connectivity
5. **Maintaining the dual storage architecture** with Supabase and Neo4j as the foundation

These changes will significantly reduce development time, improve maintainability, and enhance semantic search capabilities while preserving the core architecture design.

## Current Architecture Overview

The existing TripSage MCP plan includes:

- **Six specialized MCP servers**: Weather, Web Crawling, Flights, Accommodation, Calendar, and Memory
- **Implementation approach**: TypeScript/JavaScript with FastMCP, Node.js with Express
- **Storage systems**: Redis (caching), Supabase (relational data), Neo4j (knowledge graph)

## Technology Analysis

### 1. Time MCP

| Aspect         | Current Plan               | Recommendation                                     | Rationale                                              |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Implementation | Custom TypeScript server   | Use official Time MCP                              | Standardized functionality, reduced development effort |
| Benefits       | Customization for TripSage | Faster implementation, maintained by MCP community |                                                        |
| Integration    | Good                       | Excellent - native MCP implementation              |                                                        |

**Verdict**: KEEP with modification - Use the official Time MCP implementation rather than custom development.

### 2. Neo4j MCP Servers

| Aspect         | Current Plan                       | Recommendation                                | Rationale                                  |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Implementation | Custom Memory MCP with Neo4j       | Use official `mcp-neo4j-memory`               | Standard implementation, better maintained |
| Benefits       | Customization for TripSage         | Reduced development time, standard interfaces |                                            |
| Costs          | Development time + Neo4j licensing | Neo4j licensing only, reduced development     |                                            |
| Complexity     | High (custom implementation)       | Medium (standard implementation)              |                                            |

**Verdict**: KEEP with modification - Continue with Neo4j as the knowledge graph but adopt the official `mcp-neo4j-memory` implementation.

### 3. Vector Databases (Qdrant/Chroma)

| Aspect      | Qdrant                                | Chroma                                  | Best For                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Performance | Excellent, production-ready           | Good, better for prototyping            | Qdrant for production        |
| Features    | Rich filtering, horizontal scaling    | Simpler API, easier setup               | Depends on needs             |
| Integration | Well-documented, MCP server available | Good documentation, simpler             | Both viable                  |
| Use Cases   | Recommendations, semantic search      | Rapid prototyping, simple vector search | Qdrant for complex use cases |

**Verdict**: PLAN FOR FUTURE - Schedule Qdrant integration as a post-MVP enhancement to complement Neo4j with semantic search capabilities.

### 4. FastMCP Framework

| Aspect          | FastMCP 2.0 (Python)               | FastMCP (TypeScript)       | Advantage       |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------- |
| Development     | Active, growing ecosystem          | Less active                | Python          |
| Code Simplicity | High (decorator-based API)         | Moderate                   | Python          |
| Features        | Server+client, OpenAPI integration | Basic server functionality | Python          |
| Integration     | Strong with data science ecosystem | Standard web stack         | Depends on team |
| Maintenance     | Simpler code, fewer lines          | More verbose               | Python          |

**Verdict**: REPLACE - Standardize all custom MCP servers on Python FastMCP 2.0 rather than TypeScript.

### 5. openapi-mcp-server

| Aspect      | Value                                                     | Integration with Current Plan        |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Purpose     | Generate MCP servers from OpenAPI specs                   | Complements external API integration |
| Benefits    | Automatic tool generation, reduces code                   | Speeds up travel API integration     |
| Features    | Semantic search for endpoints, multiple transport methods | Enhances discovery and connectivity  |
| When to Use | When integrating external APIs with OpenAPI specs         | For flight, hotel, weather APIs      |

**Verdict**: ADD functionality - Either as a separate tool (TypeScript) or leveraging FastMCP 2.0's built-in OpenAPI integration (Python).

## Standardization Recommendation

We recommend **standardizing all custom MCP servers on Python FastMCP 2.0** because:

1. **Reduced development time** through decorator-based API and less boilerplate
2. **Better OpenAPI integration** for rapid connection to travel APIs
3. **More active development** than the TypeScript variant
4. **Client and server capabilities** in a single framework
5. **Compatibility** with data science and AI ecosystems

The Python implementation provides significant advantages in terms of development speed and maintainability.

## Implementation Impact

| Phase                       | Current Plan                                      | Recommended Changes                                          |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Foundation (Weeks 1-2)      | Setup infrastructure, Weather & Web Crawling MCPs | Start with Python FastMCP 2.0, use official Time MCP         |
| Travel Services (Weeks 3-4) | Flight & Accommodation MCPs                       | Leverage OpenAPI integration for faster implementation       |
| Personal Data (Weeks 5-6)   | Calendar & Memory MCPs                            | Use `mcp-neo4j-memory` for knowledge graph                   |
| Post-MVP Enhancement        | N/A                                               | Plan for Qdrant integration for semantic search capabilities |

## Hidden Costs and Complexity

1. **Neo4j**: Production licensing can be expensive; requires specialized knowledge
2. **Migration to Python**: Initial learning curve and potential integration challenges
3. **Adding Qdrant**: Additional infrastructure component to maintain
4. **Framework Standardization**: May require adjusting other backend components

## Conclusion

The recommended changes maintain the core dual-storage architecture while enhancing it with vector search capabilities and simplifying MCP server implementation. By standardizing on Python FastMCP 2.0 and adopting official MCP implementations where available, TripSage can achieve faster development, better maintainability, and enhanced semantic search capabilities.

These recommendations should be implemented with consideration for team expertise and existing investments in the technology stack. The most critical recommendation is standardizing on Python FastMCP 2.0, which provides the best foundation for rapid development of the MCP server ecosystem.
