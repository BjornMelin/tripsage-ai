# TripSage Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical documentation that has been archived to maintain project clarity while preserving development history.

## üìÅ Archived Content

### REFACTOR/ (Archived: 2025-06-01)
**Purpose**: Research and planning documentation for major architectural refactoring initiatives

**Contains**:
- **AGENTS/**: LangGraph migration research and planning (Phases 1-3 completed)
- **API_INTEGRATION/**: MCP to SDK migration research and implementation plans
- **CRAWLING/**: Web crawling and extraction system research
- **MEMORY_SEARCH/**: Database and memory system refactoring research

**Status**: These refactoring initiatives have been completed and incorporated into the main documentation. The research phase is complete, and the implemented solutions are now documented in the main docs structure.

### reviews/ (Archived: 2025-06-01)
**Purpose**: Comprehensive code review from May 30, 2025

**Contains**:
- Component-by-component analysis (8.1/10 overall score)
- Pack-based evaluation system
- Master action plan and implementation packing strategy
- PRD v2.0 documentation

**Status**: This was a point-in-time comprehensive review. The findings and recommendations have been incorporated into the main documentation and current development practices.

## üéØ Why These Were Archived

### 1. **Research Phase Complete**
The REFACTOR documentation represents completed research phases where:
- Framework comparisons and technology selections are finalized
- Migration plans have been executed and validated
- Implementation strategies have been tested and refined
- Current architecture documentation reflects the implemented decisions

### 2. **Avoid Information Overload**
Archived content was creating confusion because it:
- Mixed historical research with current implementation guidance
- Referenced deprecated architectures (Neo4j, dual-storage, 12 MCP servers)
- Contained outdated plans and analysis that are no longer relevant
- Diluted the clarity of current system documentation

### 3. **Preserve Development History**
While archived, this documentation provides valuable context for:
- Understanding the decision-making process behind current architecture
- Reviewing research methodology and validation approaches
- Maintaining institutional knowledge of alternatives considered
- Supporting future architectural evolution decisions

## üìã What Remains Active

The main documentation structure now focuses exclusively on:

### Current Architecture Documentation
- **01_PROJECT_OVERVIEW_AND_PLANNING/**: Current implementation status and consolidated API plans
- **02_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE_AND_DESIGN/**: Unified 4-layer architecture with LangGraph integration
- **03_DATABASE_AND_STORAGE/**: Supabase PostgreSQL + pgvector + Mem0 unified approach
- **04_MCP_SERVERS/**: Simplified MCP integration patterns
- **05_SEARCH_AND_CACHING/**: DragonflyDB caching and search strategies
- **06_FRONTEND/**: Next.js 15 frontend architecture
- **07_INSTALLATION_AND_SETUP/**: Current setup procedures
- **08_REFERENCE/**: API references and configuration guides
- **09_PROMPTING/**: AI prompting strategies

### Implementation-Ready Documentation
All remaining documentation is:
- ‚úÖ **Current and accurate** - reflects the implemented architecture
- ‚úÖ **Implementation-ready** - provides actionable guidance for development
- ‚úÖ **Validated** - based on completed research and testing
- ‚úÖ **Unified** - follows consistent patterns and terminology

## üîÑ Archive Policy

Documentation is archived when:
1. **Research phases complete** and findings are incorporated into main docs
2. **Architectural migrations finish** and old patterns are no longer relevant
3. **Point-in-time reviews** are superseded by current implementation status
4. **Historical alternatives** are preserved but no longer under active consideration

## üìö Accessing Archived Content

Archived content remains accessible for:
- Historical reference and context
- Understanding decision rationale
- Supporting future architectural reviews
- Maintaining development continuity

**Location**: `docs/archived/`
**Version Control**: Full history preserved in Git
**Searchability**: Included in repository searches but not in main documentation navigation
