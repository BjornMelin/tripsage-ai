# TripSage Implementation Plan and Status

**Date**: May 16, 2025 (Note: This document should be kept updated)
**Project**: TripSage AI Travel Planning System
**Overall Status**: Planning and Active Implementation Phase

## 1. Introduction

This document serves as the central hub for tracking the implementation plan, current development status, and future roadmap for the TripSage AI travel planning system. It consolidates information from previous planning, to-do, and status documents to provide a unified view of the project.

The primary goal of TripSage is to create an AI-powered travel assistant that seamlessly integrates various travel services (flights, accommodations, activities, etc.) through a Model Context Protocol (MCP) architecture, offering users a personalized and efficient travel planning experience.

## 2. Overall Project Status & Key Completed Milestones

TripSage is currently in an active implementation phase. Significant progress has been made in establishing the core architecture, integrating key MCP servers, and defining development patterns.

### Key Strategic Decisions & Architectural Shifts:

- **Standardization on Python FastMCP 2.0**: All custom MCP servers are built using this framework for consistency and maintainability.
- **Leveraging Official MCP Implementations**: Where available (e.g., Time MCP, Neo4j Memory MCP), official implementations are prioritized.
- **Dual-Storage Architecture**:
  - **Supabase (PostgreSQL)**: For structured relational data in production.
  - **Neon (PostgreSQL)**: For development and testing, leveraging its branching capabilities.
  - **Neo4j**: For the knowledge graph, managed via the official Memory MCP.
- **Shift from OpenAI Assistants API to Custom MCP-based Agents**: The core agent architecture has been refactored to interact with specialized MCP servers rather than relying directly on a monolithic Assistants API. This provides greater control, flexibility, and integration with diverse tools.
- **Centralized Configuration**: Implemented using Pydantic Settings for type-safe, environment-aware configuration management (Issue #15).
- **Hybrid Web Crawling Strategy**: Combining Crawl4AI (primary) and Playwright (fallback) for robust web data extraction.
- **Browser Automation**: Standardized on Playwright with Python, integrated via external MCPs, replacing the previous custom Browser-use implementation (Issue #26).
- **Isolated Testing Patterns**: Established for MCP clients and dual storage services to ensure reliable and environment-independent testing.

### Major Completed Milestones:

- **Core Infrastructure**:
  - Python development environment (uv) and project structure established.
  - FastMCP 2.0 base infrastructure for server and client development.
  - Relational database schema defined and migration scripts created (Supabase/Neon).
  - Neo4j knowledge graph schema defined.
  - Redis caching infrastructure implemented.
  - Centralized logging, error handling, and Pydantic-based configuration systems.
- **MCP Server Integrations**:
  - **Time MCP**: Integrated official server.
  - **Neo4j Memory MCP**: Integrated official server.
  - **Google Maps MCP**: Integrated official server (Issue #18).
  - **Airbnb MCP (OpenBnB)**: Integrated official server (Issues #17 & #24).
  - **Flights MCP**: Integrated `ravinahp/flights-mcp` (Duffel API) (Issue #16).
  - **Weather MCP**: Custom implementation with OpenWeatherMap, Visual Crossing, Weather.gov.
  - **WebCrawl MCP**: Custom implementation with Crawl4AI and Playwright (Issue #19).
  - **Browser Automation Tools**: Integrated via external Playwright MCP and Stagehand MCP (Issue #26).
- **Client Implementations**:
  - Standardized MCP clients with Pydantic v2 validation and comprehensive tests (PR #53).
  - Implemented MockMCPClient pattern for isolated testing.
- **Dual Storage**:
  - Refactored to a service-based architecture (`DualStorageService`) (Issue #69, PR #78).
  - Implemented for Trips, with plans for other entities.
- **Documentation**:
  - Significant consolidation and organization of project documentation.
  - Detailed implementation specifications for all key MCP servers.

### 4.8 Required Code Changes / Refactoring Summary

The primary architectural shift involves moving from a direct OpenAI Assistants API approach to a system of specialized MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. This change necessitates:

- **BaseAgent Class Refactoring**:
  - Modify `src/agents/base_agent.py` to interact with MCP servers instead of directly with OpenAI Assistants.
  - Integrate dual storage access (Supabase + Knowledge Graph via Memory MCP).
  - Incorporate sequential thinking/planning capabilities if a dedicated MCP is used for this.
- **Tool Interface Standardization**:
  - Define a common `MCPTool` protocol (`src/agents/tool_interface.py`) for all tools exposed by MCP servers.
- **New MCP Server Implementations**:
  - Develop dedicated modules for each MCP server (Google Maps, Airbnb, Time, etc.) as outlined in section 4.2. Each server will implement the `MCPTool` protocol for its exposed tools.
- **Knowledge Graph Client**:
  - Implement `MemoryClient` (`src/memory/knowledge_graph.py`) to interact with the Neo4j Memory MCP.
- **Sequential Thinking Integration**:
  - If a separate MCP for sequential thinking is adopted, implement its client (`src/agents/sequential_thinking.py`).
- **API Layer Changes**:
  - Add new FastAPI routes to expose functionalities of the new MCPs (e.g., `/knowledge` for the Memory MCP).
  - Update `src/api/main.py` to include these new routers.
- **Database Schema Updates**:
  - Introduce tables like `kg_entities` (to link relational data with knowledge graph nodes) and `cache_items`.
  - Update TypeScript types (`src/types/supabase.ts`) to reflect schema changes.
- **TravelAgent Class Updates**:
  - Refactor `src/agents/travel_agent.py` to use the new MCP server architecture and clients.
  - Implement context building using the Memory MCP.
  - Update tool calling logic to route to the appropriate MCP tools.
- **Configuration Updates**:
  - Expand `src/agents/config.py` (or the new centralized settings) to include endpoints and API keys for all MCP servers.
- **Frontend API Client**:
  - Update or create a new frontend API client (`src/frontend/api/tripSageApi.ts`) to interact with the refactored backend API, including any new endpoints related to MCP functionalities.
- **Caching Implementation**:
  - Implement a Redis-based caching system (`src/cache/redis_cache.py`) to cache responses from MCP servers and other frequently accessed data.

These changes are integral to the tasks listed in the detailed plan, particularly within the "MCP Server Implementation" and "Agent Development" sections.
