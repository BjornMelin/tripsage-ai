## 🔐 Security Principles

TripSage implements defense-in-depth security with multiple layers:

1. **Database-Level Security** - PostgreSQL Row Level Security (RLS)
2. **Application-Level Security** - JWT authentication and authorization
3. **API Security** - Rate limiting, request validation, and CORS
4. **Infrastructure Security** - TLS encryption, secure configurations
5. **Data Security** - AES-128 encryption for sensitive data

## 📊 Security Metrics

- **RLS Coverage**: 100% of user-owned tables have proper isolation
- **Test Coverage**: 90%+ security test coverage maintained  
- **Performance Impact**: <10ms RLS policy overhead
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: 8 critical issues identified and resolved
