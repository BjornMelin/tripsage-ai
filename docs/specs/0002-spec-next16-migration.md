# Spec: Next.js 16 Migration (Proxy, Async APIs, Turbopack)

**Version**: 1.1.0
**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2025-10-24

## Objective

Upgrade the app to Next.js 16 by migrating middleware -> proxy, enforcing async Request APIs, and finalizing turbopack config. Ensure all SSR pages comply and builds/prerenders are clean.

## Scope

- Replace middleware.ts with proxy.ts.
- Ensure all usage of `cookies`, `headers`, `draftMode`, and route `params/searchParams` are async.
- Fix SSR auth on sensitive routes (e.g., reset-password page) to avoid client hooks in server.

## Implementation Checklist

- [x] Replace `src/middleware.ts` with `src/proxy.ts`; export `proxy()`.
- [x] Keep existing `matcher` negative lookahead for static/image files.
- [x] Move `experimental.turbopack` to top-level `turbopack` in `next.config.ts`.
- [x] Audit all server components/route handlers:
  - [x] Verified `createServerSupabase()` awaits `cookies()` before auth calls in `app/auth/confirm/route.ts`.
  - [x] Confirmed route handlers (`app/api/chat/route.ts`, `app/api/chat/attachments/route.ts`) avoid synchronous Request APIs and operate on payloads only.
- [ ] SSR auth page fixes:
  - [x] `src/lib/supabase/server.ts` exists with `createServerSupabase()` wrapper.
  - [ ] Update `app/(auth)/reset-password/page.tsx` to server-read auth with the server client (no `useAuth` hook in server). If client interactivity is required, split into server + client child.
  - [ ] Validate build no longer fails at prerender.
- [x] Wrap client/dynamic UI usage in `<Suspense>` where necessary to comply with Cache Components prerender rules.
- [x] Removed legacy `dynamic`/`revalidate` segment configs that conflict with `cacheComponents`.
- [x] Docs
  - [x] ADR-0013 captures design.
  - [x] `docs/index.md` lists Next 16 migration notes; users section requires no changes.

## Notes

- Proxy defaults to Node runtime; avoid edge-only assumptions.
- Use matchers to limit proxy scope.
- Async Request APIs are mandatory in v16; consider using `npx next typegen` to adopt `PageProps` helpers for `params/searchParams` typing.

### 2025-10-23 SSR audit log

- Route handlers reviewed: `app/api/chat/route.ts`, `app/api/chat/attachments/route.ts`, and `app/auth/confirm/route.ts`. The confirm handler is the only Supabase call site and defers to `createServerSupabase()`, which awaits `cookies()` before invoking Supabase APIs to opt out of public caching. Route handlers without Supabase dependencies do not access `cookies()`/`headers()` directly and operate purely on request payloads.
- `app/api/chat/attachments/route.ts` now revalidates the `attachments` cache tag for both single and batch payloads right before returning, using `revalidateTag('attachments', 'max')` to mark cache entries stale without blocking.
- Chat: the native Next.js chat route has been removed; the UI calls the canonical FastAPI endpoints at `${NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL}/api/chat/stream` (streaming, SSE) and `${NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL}/api/v1/chat/` (legacy JSON). If a BFF is needed in the future, it must be a thin forwarder only.
- The attachments endpoint remains annotated with `"use cache: private"` so uploads stay user-scoped while allowing follow-up fetches to reuse cached metadata where appropriate.

## Changelog

- 1.1.0 (2025-10-24)
  - Clarified `revalidateTag('attachments', 'max')` usage and removed ambiguous phrasing.
  - Added versioned metadata (semver) and changelog section.
- 1.0.0 (2025-10-23)
  - Initial specification for v16 migration (proxy, async APIs, turbopack).
