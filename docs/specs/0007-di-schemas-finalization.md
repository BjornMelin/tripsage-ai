# Spec 0007 — Final DI + Pydantic v2 Schemas Centralization (Final-Only)

Status: Accepted

Owners: Platform API

Date: 2025-10-24

## Executive Summary

This spec concludes our “final-only” migration to FastAPI `app.state` DI and Pydantic v2 schema centralization across the API layer. We removed all competing DI patterns and centralized request/response models under `tripsage/api/schemas`. This document finalizes the remaining work: dashboard realtime models, schema audit for Pydantic v2, strict response contracts, enum normalization, OpenAPI snapshot tests, and router policy tests that prevent inline `BaseModel` definitions in routers.

Scope explicitly excludes anything already implemented and verified (memory/attachments/health/trips params centralization; dashboard router refactor; README/CHANGELOG updates; lifespan smoke; limiter signatures for memory/chat; targeted test fixes). This spec covers only the remaining work to reach “no legacy code, no back-compat, no dead code”.

## Decision Framework

- Solution Leverage (35%): 0.95 — Library-first schemas and FastAPI validation enforce contracts and accurate OpenAPI.
- Application Value (30%): 0.90 — Consistent, documented API improves reliability and client integrations.
- Maintenance Load (25%): 0.90 — Centralized schemas reduce duplication and test brittleness.
- Adaptability (10%): 0.85 — Versionable schemas and snapshot tests enable controlled evolution.

Weighted score: 9.13/10. Proceed.

## Inputs and Evidence

- Code review (internal + tool-assisted) of `tripsage/api/*` confirming remaining inline models in `dashboard_realtime.py`, response_model gaps, and lingering Pydantic v1 kwargs in schemas (regex/min_items) — validated and partially fixed (see PR diff where applicable).
- Targeted pytest runs for dashboard endpoints now green after centralization and test rebaseline.
- Pydantic v2 guidance: use `pattern=` (not `regex`) and `min_length`/`max_length` for list cardinality.

## Final Plan (Phased)

### Phase A — Dashboard Realtime Centralization (Routers + Schemas)

- Files
  - Source: `tripsage/api/routers/dashboard_realtime.py`
  - Target schemas: `tripsage/api/schemas/dashboard_realtime.py`

- Tasks
  - Move router-local `RealtimeMetrics`, `AlertNotification`, `SystemEvent` into new schemas module under responses.
  - Update router to import centralized models, and add `response_model` on every endpoint:
    - `GET /dashboard/realtime/events` → `list[SystemEvent]`
    - `POST /dashboard/realtime/alerts/broadcast` → `{success: bool}` or typed `BroadcastResponse`
    - `POST /dashboard/realtime/events/broadcast` → typed `BroadcastResponse`
    - `GET /dashboard/realtime/connections` → typed `ConnectionsStatusResponse`
  - Normalize any enums to the shared dashboard enums where relevant.
  - Remove all inline `BaseModel` from the router.

- Tests
  - Update/add unit tests in `tests/unit/api/routers/test_dashboard_realtime_router.py` asserting response models and payload shapes.
  - Ensure no direct dependency on router-local models remains.

### Phase B — Schemas v2 Audit (repo-wide under `tripsage/api/schemas`)

- Files
  - All under `tripsage/api/schemas/**/*`

- Tasks
  - Replace Pydantic v1 kwargs with v2 equivalents: `regex` → `pattern`, `min_items` → `min_length` (for lists), etc.
  - Confirm validators are v2-compliant (use `@field_validator`/`@model_validator` patterns as needed).
  - Ensure request vs response split is respected; migrate any remaining router-local DTOs to requests/responses packages.
  - Add `ErrorEnvelope` and reuse for typed error responses where routers catch exceptions.

- Tests
  - `tests/unit/api/policy/test_schemas_v2.py` — quick import/smoke ensuring no v1-only kwargs appear.

### Phase C — Response Model Enforcement (All Routers)

- Files
  - Routers with gaps: `tripsage/api/routers/attachments.py` (read/list/delete/download), `search.py` (analytics), `itineraries.py` (some endpoints), `config.py` (rollback, environment), plus any others found by scan.

- Tasks
  - Add/align `response_model` on every endpoint.
  - Define missing response schemas under feature modules (e.g., `schemas/attachments.py` for `FileMetadataResponse`, `FileListResponse`, `DeleteFileResponse`).
  - Set `response_model_exclude_none=True` selectively to keep wire formats stable.
  - Ensure FastAPI `validate_response=True` for critical endpoints.

- Tests
  - Adjust existing tests expecting free-form dicts to assert typed models instead.
  - Add OpenAPI snapshot (see Phase D).

### Phase D — Contract Guardrails (Policy + OpenAPI Snapshot)

- Files
  - Policy test: `tests/unit/api/policy/test_router_schema_policy.py`
  - Snapshot: `tests/unit/api/policy/test_openapi_snapshot.py`

- Tasks
  - Router Policy: fail if any `tripsage/api/routers/*.py` declares `BaseModel` subclasses (regex or AST-based check). This enforces no inline DTOs.
  - OpenAPI snapshot: export `/openapi.json` for the app and compare against a committed golden file. Fail on breaking changes. Allow additive changes via explicit snapshot update.

### Phase E — Enum Normalization and Safety

- Files
  - `tripsage/api/routers/dashboard.py`, `keys.py`, `trips.py` (and others using enums)
  - `tripsage/api/schemas/*` enum definitions

- Tasks
  - Convert string literal returns to typed enums at the router edge.
  - Provide safe parsing from service-produced strings using `getattr(x, "value", x)` before enum construction; add sensible fallbacks.
  - Use enum comparisons in sorting and branching logic.

### Phase F — Docs + Changelog

- Files
  - README.md (already updated DI + schema policy)
  - CHANGELOG.md (append Phase A–E bullets under Refactor)
  - Developers guide: add section on “No router-local BaseModel policy” and “OpenAPI snapshot workflow”.

## File → Task Mapping (Remaining Only)

- `tripsage/api/routers/dashboard_realtime.py`
  - Remove inline models; import from `schemas/responses/dashboard_realtime.py`.
  - Add `response_model` on all endpoints.

- `tripsage/api/schemas/dashboard_realtime.py` (new)
  - Define `RealtimeMetrics`, `AlertNotification`, `SystemEvent`, `BroadcastResponse`, `ConnectionsStatusResponse`.

- `tripsage/api/routers/attachments.py`
  - Add response models on `get_file_metadata`, `delete_file`, `list_user_files`, `download_file`.
  - New schemas in `schemas/responses/attachments.py` if missing.

- `tripsage/api/schemas/**/*`
  - Replace v1-only kwargs; ensure v2 validators.

- Tests under `tests/unit/api/routers/` and `tests/integration/`
  - Rebaseline to new typed responses.
  - Add policy and openapi snapshot tests.

## Quality Gates

- Activate venv: `source .venv/bin/activate`
- Format/Lint/Type:
  - `ruff format . && ruff check . --fix`
  - `uv run pyright`
  - `uv run pylint tripsage tripsage_core`
- Tests:
  - `uv run pytest --maxfail=1 -q`
  - Coverage target remains ≥90% for touched modules; openapi snapshot and policy tests included.

## Risks and Mitigations

- Test breakage from stricter response models → Rebaseline tests alongside router changes; snapshot guards to stabilize.
- Schema drift across domains → Router policy test prevents future inline DTOs; single-source schemas enforce shapes.
- Unknown enum/string values → Safe mapping with fallbacks; log and continue.

## Rollout & Cleanup

- Single PR/branch completing Phases A–E; delete all superseded router-local models immediately.
- Update CHANGELOG under Refactor:
  - “Dashboard Realtime: centralized response models; added strict response_model contracts.”
  - “Pydantic v2 audit across schemas; removed v1-only kwargs.”
  - “Router policy and OpenAPI snapshot tests added to enforce final-only pattern.”

## Acceptance Criteria

- No inline `BaseModel` classes in any router files.
- Every endpoint declares `response_model` and returns schema-conformant data.
- OpenAPI snapshot test passes; policy test passes.
- Ruff, Pyright, Pylint clean for touched modules; pytest green for updated suites.
