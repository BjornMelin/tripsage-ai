# Release logs (tracked evidence)

This directory contains **captured output** from local/CI commands run during release readiness work (e.g., `pnpm test:e2e`, `pnpm build`, route listings).

- These files are intended as **audit/evidence artifacts** referenced by release docs (for example: `docs/release/01-current-state-audit.md` and `docs/release/02-gap-analysis.md`).
- When re-running the release process, regenerate and update the relevant log files instead of editing them by hand.
