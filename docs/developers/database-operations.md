# Database Migration Reports

This document consolidates reports on significant database migration efforts within the TripSage project.

## Report 1: Migration from `src/db/` to MCP-Based Approach

**Date of Completion**: Approximately June 16, 2025 (as per original report)  
**Status**: COMPLETE ✅

### 1.1. Summary

This migration involved transitioning the database access layer from a direct connection and repository pattern (previously located in the `src/db/` directory) to a new architecture centered around Model Context Protocol (MCP) abstractions. The primary goal was to decouple application logic from direct database dependencies, improve testability, and standardize data access patterns.

### 1.2. What Was Migrated

#### Core Business Models

- ✅ **User Model** (`src/db/models/user.py` → `tripsage/models/db/user.py`):
  - Preserved all business logic and validation rules.
  - Maintained preference management functionality.
  - Updated to Pydantic V2 patterns.
- ✅ **Trip Model** (`src/db/models/trip.py` → `tripsage/models/db/trip.py`):
  - Migrated enums (e.g., `TripStatus`, `Currency`).
  - Preserved business logic (e.g., duration calculation).
  - Added comprehensive validation.
- ❌ **Flight Model**:
  - Not directly migrated to the new database model structure.
  - Flight operations are now primarily handled via the Flights MCP.
  - A `Flight` model exists in `tripsage/models/flight.py` for MCP integration and API responses.

#### Database Operations

All database operations were refactored to be performed through MCP tools:

- ✅ **SQL Operations (via Supabase MCP / Neon MCP)**:

  - Generic CRUD operations now available via standardized tools.
  - Domain-specific operations re-implemented or mapped to MCP tools:
    - `find_user_by_email`
    - `find_users_by_name_pattern`
    - `update_user_preferences`
    - `create_trip`
    - `find_trips_by_user`
    - `find_trips_by_destination`
    - `find_active_trips_by_date_range`
    - `execute_sql` (for raw SQL).

- ✅ **Neo4j Graph Operations (via Memory MCP)**:
  - Knowledge graph operations now accessed through Memory MCP tools:
    - `find_destinations_by_country`
    - `find_nearby_destinations`
    - `find_popular_destinations`
    - `search_destination_activities`
    - `create_trip_entities`
    - `find_accommodations_in_destination`.

#### Migration System Infrastructure

- ✅ **SQL Migrations Runner**:
  - Updated to use Supabase CLI migration system.
  - Uses `supabase db push` and `supabase migration` commands for schema management.
- ✅ **Neo4j Migrations Runner**:
  - Introduced or updated scripts for Neo4j schema setup.
  - Applies constraints, creates indexes, etc.
- ✅ **Unified Migration Scripting**:
  - A unified way to trigger migrations for both database types, possibly via a CLI.
- ✅ **Database Initialization Scripts**:
  - `src/db/initialize.py` refactored to `tripsage/db/initialize.py`.
  - Uses MCP clients for database connections and verifying schema.

### 1.3. Missing Operations (Post-Migration, Low to Medium Priority)

The following operations from the old `src/db/` layer were identified as not immediately migrated:

#### User Operations (Priority: Medium)

- ❌ `set_admin_status`
- ❌ `set_disabled_status`
- ❌ `update_password`
- ❌ `get_admins`

#### Trip Operations (Priority: Medium)

- ❌ `get_upcoming_trips`

#### Flight Operations (Priority: High, if database persistence beyond MCP is needed)

- ❌ `find_flights_by_trip_id`
- ❌ `find_flights_by_route`
- ❌ `find_flights_by_date_range`
- ❌ `update_flight_booking_status`
- ❌ `get_flight_statistics`

### 1.4. Architectural Changes and Benefits

**Old Architecture (`src/db/`)**:

- Direct database clients and repository pattern.
- Models tightly coupled with DB specifics.

**New Architecture (MCP-based)**:

- **Models**: Pydantic-based, focusing on data structure/validation.
- **Tools**: Database operations exposed as MCP tools.
- **Migrations**: MCP-based or script-based runners.
- **MCP Abstraction Layer**: Manages connections/interactions with DB MCPs.

**Key Benefits**:

1. **Separation of Concerns**.
2. **Standardized Error Handling**.
3. **Improved Testability**.
4. **Scalability and Flexibility**.
5. **Enhanced Type Safety**.

### 1.5. Files Deleted

All files/subdirectories in the old `src/db/` path were removed after migration or deemed obsolete, including:

- `src/db/client.py`
- `src/db/config.py`
- `src/db/exceptions.py`
- `src/db/factory.py`
- `src/db/initialize.py`
- `src/db/migrations.py`
- `src/db/providers.py`
- `src/db/query_builder.py`
- `src/db/models/`
- `src/db/repositories/`
- `src/db/neo4j/`

### 1.6. Testing Post-Migration

A comprehensive test suite was created:

- Unit tests for MCP tools.
- Model validation tests for Pydantic schemas.
- Integration tests verifying end-to-end data flow.

### 1.7. Conclusion of Report 1

The migration to an MCP-based approach is complete and has modernized TripSage's data access layer. The old `src/db/` directory and contents have been removed. Missing operations are documented for future implementation.

## Modern Database Operations with Supabase CLI

**Status**: CURRENT OPERATIONAL STANDARD (June 2025)  
**Migration Path**: From legacy migrations/ to supabase/ directory structure

### Current Development Workflow

#### 1. Local Development Setup

```bash
# Initialize Supabase in project (if not already done)
supabase init

# Start local development environment
supabase start

# Link to remote project
supabase link --project-ref [your-project-ref]

# Pull remote schema to local
supabase db pull
```

#### 2. Creating and Managing Migrations

```bash
# Create a new migration
supabase migration new add_travel_preferences

# This creates: supabase/migrations/[timestamp]_add_travel_preferences.sql

# Edit the migration file, then apply locally
supabase db reset

# Generate TypeScript types from schema
supabase gen types typescript --local > database.types.ts
```

#### 3. Production Deployment

```bash
# Push migrations to production
supabase db push

# Verify deployment
supabase projects list
supabase db inspect
```

### Migration File Organization

**Current Structure:**

```text
supabase/
├── config.toml
├── migrations/
│   ├── 20250526_01_enable_pgvector_extensions.sql
│   ├── 20250527_01_mem0_memory_system.sql
│   └── [timestamp]_[description].sql
├── functions/ (Edge Functions)
└── seed.sql (Development seed data)
```

**Legacy Structure (Deprecated):**

```text
migrations/ (REMOVED)
├── 20250508_01_initial_schema_core_tables.sql
├── 20250508_02_dependent_tables.sql
└── rollbacks/ (REMOVED)
```

### Best Practices for Modern Schema Management

1. **Use Supabase CLI exclusively** for all database operations
2. **Test locally first** with `supabase db reset` before pushing
3. **Generate types** after schema changes with `supabase gen types`
4. **Version control** all migration files in supabase/migrations/
5. **Use descriptive names** for migration files
6. **Never edit applied migrations** - create new ones for changes

### Environment Configuration

```toml
# supabase/config.toml
[db]
port = 54322
shadow_port = 54320
major_version = 15

[db.extensions]
enabled = ["vector", "uuid-ossp", "pg_stat_statements"]

[auth]
enabled = true
external_providers = ["google", "github"]

[storage]
enabled = true
bucket_limit = 100
```

### Common Operations

```bash
# Reset local database to match remote
supabase db pull
supabase db reset

# Check migration status
supabase migration list

# Validate schema
supabase db lint

# Generate seed data
supabase db dump --data-only > supabase/seed.sql

# Backup production data
supabase db dump --remote > backup.sql
```
