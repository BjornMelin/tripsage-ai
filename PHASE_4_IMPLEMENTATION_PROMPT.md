# Phase 4: File Handling & Attachments - Implementation Prompt

## Context
âœ… **COMPLETED** - Phase 4 of the AI Chat Integration for TripSage has been successfully implemented on May 23, 2025. Phase 1 (Chat API Endpoint Enhancement and Session Management) was completed in PR #118 and PR #122. Phase 2 (Authentication & BYOK Integration) was completed in PR #123. Phase 3 (Testing Infrastructure & Dependencies) was completed in the current session with comprehensive testing solutions and zero linting errors. Phase 4 (File Handling & Attachments) is now complete with secure file upload system, AI-powered document analysis, and comprehensive validation.

## Your Task

- âœ… Performance testing (large files <30s)
- âœ… Concurrent upload handling
- âœ… User isolation verification

### 8. KISS Principle Enforcement
**"Always do the simplest thing that works" - Question all complexity**

```bash
# Implementation Checkpoints
â–¡ Can this be solved with existing libraries/patterns?
â–¡ Are we implementing only explicitly requested features? (YAGNI)
â–¡ Is the code readable by a developer 6 months from now?
â–¡ Are we avoiding over-engineering or premature optimization?
â–¡ Have we documented WHY certain approaches were chosen?

# Complexity Challenges
- File storage: Start with local filesystem, add S3 only if needed
- AI analysis: Use simple OpenAI calls, avoid complex prompt chains initially  
- Frontend: Use existing UI patterns, avoid custom file handling if possible
- Validation: Leverage existing validation libraries, don't reinvent
- Processing: Sequential processing first, async/batch only if performance requires it
```

**Decision Documentation:** For any non-obvious choice, document the reasoning in code comments:
```python
# Choice: Using local file storage instead of S3
# Reason: KISS principle - S3 adds complexity, local storage sufficient for Phase 4
# Future: Can migrate to S3 when scaling requirements are clear
```

## Code Patterns to Follow

### File Upload API
```python
# In tripsage/api/routers/attachments.py
from fastapi import UploadFile, File, HTTPException, Depends
from tripsage.services.file_processor import FileProcessor
from tripsage.utils.file_validation import validate_file

@router.post("/upload")
async def upload_file(
    file: UploadFile = File(...),
    current_user: UserDB = Depends(get_current_user),
    processor: FileProcessor = Depends(get_file_processor)
):
    """Upload and process a file attachment."""
    # Validate file
    validation_result = await validate_file(file)
    if not validation_result.is_valid:
        raise HTTPException(400, validation_result.error_message)
    
    # Process file
    result = await processor.process_file(file, current_user.id)
    
    return {
        "file_id": result.file_id,
        "analysis": result.analysis,
        "extracted_data": result.extracted_data
    }
```

### Document Analysis Service
```python
# In tripsage/services/document_analyzer.py
from openai import AsyncOpenAI
from typing import Dict, Any, Optional

class DocumentAnalyzer:
    """AI-powered document analysis for travel files."""
    
    async def analyze_travel_document(
        self, 
        file_content: str, 
        file_type: str
    ) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Analyze uploaded document for travel information."""
        
        prompt = self._get_analysis_prompt(file_type)
        
        response = await self.openai_client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4",
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content": prompt},
                {"role": "user", "content": file_content}
            ],
            temperature=0.1
        )
        
        return self._parse_analysis_result(response)
    
    def _get_analysis_prompt(self, file_type: str) -> str:
        """Get travel-specific analysis prompt."""
        return f"""
        Analyze this {file_type} document for travel-related information.
        Extract and structure any:
        - Dates and times
        - Locations and addresses
        - Flight/hotel/rental information
        - Costs and pricing
        - Contact information
        - Important notes or requirements
        
        Return structured JSON with extracted data.
        """
```

### Frontend File Upload
```typescript
// In frontend/src/components/features/chat/file-upload.tsx
import { useState, useCallback } from 'react';
import { useDropzone } from 'react-dropzone';

interface FileUploadProps {
  onFileAnalyzed: (analysis: FileAnalysis) => void;
}

export function FileUpload({ onFileAnalyzed }: FileUploadProps) {
  const [uploading, setUploading] = useState(false);
  const [progress, setProgress] = useState(0);

  const onDrop = useCallback(async (files: File[]) => {
    setUploading(true);
    
    for (const file of files) {
      try {
        const formData = new FormData();
        formData.append('file', file);
        
        const response = await fetch('/api/v1/attachments/upload', {
          method: 'POST',
          body: formData,
          headers: {
            'Authorization': `Bearer ${getAuthToken()}`
          }
        });
        
        if (response.ok) {
          const result = await response.json();
          onFileAnalyzed(result);
        }
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Upload failed:', error);
      }
    }
    
    setUploading(false);
  }, [onFileAnalyzed]);

  const { getRootProps, getInputProps, isDragActive } = useDropzone({
    onDrop,
    accept: {
      'application/pdf': ['.pdf'],
      'image/*': ['.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png', '.webp'],
      'text/*': ['.txt', '.csv']
    },
    maxSize: 10 * 1024 * 1024, // 10MB
    multiple: true
  });

  return (
    <div 
      {...getRootProps()} 
      className={`upload-zone ${isDragActive ? 'active' : ''}`}
    >
      <input {...getInputProps()} />
      {uploading ? (
        <UploadProgress progress={progress} />
      ) : (
        <UploadPrompt />
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Testing Requirements
- **Unit tests** for file validation and processing (100% coverage target)
- **Integration tests** for upload and analysis flow
- **Security tests** for file type and content validation + malicious file detection
- **Performance tests** for large file handling (<30s requirement)
- **E2E tests** for complete file upload experience
- **Error handling tests** for malformed or malicious files
- **Concurrent access tests** for user isolation verification

## Success Criteria
1. âœ… **Security**: Comprehensive file validation prevents malicious uploads
2. âœ… **AI Analysis**: Accurately extracts travel information from documents
3. âœ… **Integration**: Seamless chat interface integration with file processing
4. âœ… **UX**: Smooth upload progress indicators and error handling
5. âœ… **Management**: File operations (view, delete, re-analyze) work correctly
6. âœ… **Performance**: Large file processing completes within 30 seconds
7. âœ… **Quality**: All tests pass with **100% coverage** (upgraded from >90%)
8. âœ… **Simplicity**: Implementation follows KISS principle, documented decisions

## Important Notes
- Follow KISS principle - focus on essential file types first
- Use existing MCP patterns for external integrations
- Implement robust error handling and validation
- Ensure mobile-friendly file upload experience
- Plan for scalable file storage architecture
- Run `ruff check --fix` and `ruff format .` on Python files
- Run `npx biome lint --apply` and `npx biome format --write` on TypeScript files

## File Processing Strategy

### Supported Use Cases
1. **Travel Documents**: Boarding passes, hotel confirmations, rental agreements
2. **Planning Documents**: Itineraries, travel guides, research notes
3. **Financial Documents**: Receipts, expense reports, budget spreadsheets
4. **Identity Documents**: Passport scans, visa documents (secure handling)
5. **Media Files**: Destination photos, maps, screenshots

### Processing Pipeline
1. **Upload & Validation**: Secure file receipt and initial validation
2. **Content Extraction**: Text, image, or data extraction based on file type
3. **AI Analysis**: Intelligent parsing for travel-relevant information
4. **Structured Output**: Convert extracted data to standardized format
5. **Integration**: Merge results with chat context and trip planning
6. **Storage**: Secure long-term storage with user access controls

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation for unsupported file types
- Clear error messages for validation failures
- Retry mechanisms for transient processing failures
- Fallback to manual processing when AI analysis fails
- Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
