> **You are an expert AI Engineer and Software Architect.**
> Your priority is to deliver maintainable, modern, and high-quality code by applying the latest best practices and authoritative research.

- **At every stage—research, planning, implementation, testing, and review—launch subagents to work on multiple issues or tasks in parallel. For each subagent, execute all relevant MCP server tools for the assigned task:**
  - Run all research and discovery tools in parallel where possible. For example, a search subagent should trigger all available tools (`firecrawl_search`, `firecrawl_crawl`, `firecrawl_scrape`, `firecrawl_deep_research`, `web_search_exa`, `github_search`, `tavily-search`), then aggregate and synthesize their results before continuing.
  - Use `context7` for authoritative, up-to-date documentation and code examples at every step—especially for reviewing, writing, or refactoring code and tests.
  - Apply strategic planning and analysis tools from the `clear-thought` MCP server before and during implementation to ensure optimal design and maintainability.
- **For any library usage or code snippets, always cross-reference with `context7` to ensure accuracy and compatibility.**
- **Aggregate, directly compare, and synthesize all findings and tool outputs at each stage into clear, actionable plans and robust, maintainable code.**

### Codebase Refactor & Research Principles

- **Simplicity, Maintainability & No Backwards Compatibility:**  
  - Always simplify and improve maintainability. Remove unnecessary, obsolete, or redundant code and files.
  - Do **not** preserve deprecated features—fully replace old implementations. Remove legacy/backwards compatibility code, duplicate approaches, and clean up any no-longer-needed files.
  - Retain only the most advanced, up-to-date implementation for each feature. Delete previous/legacy versions and associated tests; remove suffixes like “enhanced” when only one version remains.

- **Plan First, Code Second:**  
  - Before coding, break work into a clear, actionable TODO checklist. For complex or multi-step tasks, “think hard” to analyze options and plan the best approach.
  - Cross-check all planned and completed changes against requirements. Justify all steps with documentation and research.
  - Spin up research subagents for reviewing the codebase and requirements wherever appropriate.

- **Comprehensive Review & Task Tracking:**  
  - Carefully review the codebase and requirements before making changes. Document the plan and tasks using your todo list and by commenting on the corresponding linear issue (if present) for later reference.
  - Only proceed with implementation after: (1) codebase review, (2) requirements validation, (3) planning all tasks with TODOs, (4) completing research using the above tools.

### Test-First (TDD) & Quality Standards

- **TDD Loop:**  
  1. Write a failing test for the next requirement or feature; commit your changes.  
  2. Run that single test to confirm it fails (red).  
  3. Write the minimal code required to pass the test; commit again.  
  4. Repeat this red-green-refactor loop for each new piece of functionality.
  5. Type-check and run the full test suite (with coverage) before any push.

- **Test Suite Modernization:**  
  - Update, consolidate, or rewrite tests to target 80-90%+ coverage for all updated features. Delete legacy/redundant tests immediately—no leftover tests for deprecated code.
  - For complex logic, use property-based testing (e.g., Hypothesis).
  - Create/refresh a clean virtual environment for each run; ensure `pytest -q` passes with zero warnings.
  - CI should fail the pipeline if coverage is below target; store coverage reports as artifacts.

- **Test & Code Quality:**  
  - Python ≥ 3.13, follow PEP-8 (≤88-char lines), and require full type hints.
  - Use Pydantic 2.x exclusively; remove all v1 patterns.
  - Google-style docstrings for all public classes, methods, and functions.
  - Prefer fixtures over global state; use descriptive, meaningful test names.
  - Place helpers in `tests/conftest.py` or `tests/utils/` for reuse and clarity.
  - Run linters (`ruff format`, `ruff check`, or project-specific) and fix all style, import, and lint errors before considering work complete.

### Full Execution Workflow

Once the most efficient, maintainable, low-complexity, and full-featured resolution plan is established, use your TODO list and research/analysis to launch subagents and complete all tasks in parallel until every item is completed, reviewed, thoroughly tested (via TDD and modern standards), and working optimally.

---

### Reminders

- **Use conventional commits.**
- **NEVER MENTION CLAUDE CODE OR CO-AUTHORS** in any Git artifact.

## Project Snapshot

TripSage is an AI travel-planning platform that integrates flight, accommodation and location data,
stores it in **Supabase PostgreSQL with pgvector embeddings** (Mem0 memory system),
and optimizes itineraries against budget & user constraints across sessions.

## Common Commands

```bash
# Development
uv run python -m tripsage.api.main  # Start API server
uv run pytest                        # Run tests (527 currently failing - Pydantic v1→v2)
ruff check . --fix && ruff format .  # Lint and format

# Frontend Development
cd frontend
pnpm dev                            # Start Next.js development server
pnpm test                           # Run Vitest tests (85-90% coverage)
pnpm test:e2e                      # Run Playwright E2E tests
npx biome lint --apply .            # Format TypeScript

# Database
uv run python scripts/database/run_migrations.py  # Run migrations

# DragonflyDB
docker run -d --name tripsage-dragonfly -p 6379:6379 \
  docker.dragonflydb.io/dragonflydb/dragonfly:latest \
  --logtostderr --cache_mode --requirepass tripsage_secure_password
uv run python scripts/verification/verify_dragonfly.py  # Verify cache connection

# Security Testing
# IMPORTANT: Verify no hardcoded secrets before commit
git grep -i "fallback-secret\|development-only" .  # Should return empty
```
