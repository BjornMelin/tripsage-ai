# CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

This directory contains the simplified GitHub Actions workflows for the TripSage AI project.

## Workflows

### 1. CI (`ci.yml`)

#### Minimal PR/Push workflow for backend and frontend

- **Triggers**: Push/PR to `main` and `develop`
- **Jobs**:
  - **Backend**: Ruff lint, Pyright (soft-fail initially), unit tests (soft-fail initially)
  - **Frontend**: Biome lint, TypeScript `--noEmit`, unit tests
- **Design**:
  - Path filters scope jobs to relevant changes
  - No matrices, no comment bots, no redundant gates

### 2. Deployment (`deploy.yml`)

#### Vercel deployment automation with concurrency control

- **Triggers**:
  - Push to main branch
  - Successful completion of Frontend CI workflow
- **Jobs**:
  - **Production Deploy**: Deploys to Vercel production
  - **Preview Deploy**: Creates preview deployments for PRs
- **Features**:
  - Concurrency control to prevent deployment conflicts
  - Automatic artifact handling

### 3. Weekly Security (`security.yml`)

#### Scheduled and manual secret scanning

- **Schedule**: Weekly (Monday 02:00 UTC)
- **Scanner**: gitleaks action (prefer GH Advanced Secret Scanning when available)
- **Noise reduction**: `.github/secret_scanning.yml` excludes example env templates

### 4. Dependabot (`dependabot.yml`)

#### Automated dependency updates

- **Schedule**: Weekly on Mondays at 9:00 AM
- **Scope**:
  - Frontend NPM packages (grouped by type)
  - Python dependencies
  - GitHub Actions
- **Configuration**: Auto-assigns to @BjornMelin for review

## Setup Requirements

### Environment Variables

Add these secrets to your GitHub repository:

```bash
# Vercel deployment
VERCEL_TOKEN=your_vercel_token
VERCEL_ORG_ID=your_org_id
VERCEL_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id

# Optional: Code coverage
CODECOV_TOKEN=your_codecov_token
```

ðŸ“– **For detailed deployment setup with cost estimates, see [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md)**

### Branch Protection

Recommended branch protection rules for `main`:

- Require status checks to pass before merging
- Require branches to be up to date before merging
- Required status checks (rename as needed in repository settings):
  - `CI / Backend (lint, type, unit)`
  - `CI / Frontend (lint, type, unit)`

## Workflow Features

### Build Caching

- Next.js build cache using GitHub Actions cache
- Dependency caching with pnpm
- Significantly reduces build times

### Test Coverage

- Vitest unit tests with coverage reporting
- Playwright E2E tests with HTML reports
- Coverage uploads to Codecov (if configured)

### Quality Checks

- Biome for fast linting and formatting
- ESLint for additional React/Next.js rules
- TypeScript strict type checking
- Security vulnerability scanning

### Deployment

- Automatic production deployment on main branch
- Preview deployments for pull requests
- Vercel integration with optimized builds

## Usage

### For Development

1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/your-feature`
2. Make changes in `frontend/` directory
3. Push to trigger CI: `git push origin feat/your-feature`
4. Create PR to see preview deployment

### For Production

1. Merge PR to main branch
2. Automatic deployment to production
3. Monitor deployment status in GitHub Actions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Build Failures

- Check Node.js version compatibility (uses Node 20)
- Verify pnpm lockfile is up to date
- Review build logs for specific errors

#### Test Failures

- Unit tests may fail due to incomplete mocking
- E2E tests require successful build
- Check test reports in GitHub Actions artifacts

#### Deployment Issues

- Verify Vercel secrets are configured
- Check Vercel project settings
- Review deployment logs in Vercel dashboard

### Getting Help

- Check GitHub Actions logs for detailed error messages
- Review individual job outputs
- Use simple CI workflow for rapid iteration during development
