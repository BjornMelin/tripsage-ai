# System Architecture and Design

This section provides detailed documentation on the architectural principles, design patterns, and overall structure of the TripSage AI Travel Planning System. It covers how different components interact, the design of AI agents, and strategies for deployment and optimization.

## Contents

- **[System Architecture Overview](./SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md)**:

  - A high-level view of TripSage's components and their interactions. This includes the main application layers, MCP server integrations, and the data flow within the system. It also details the MCP abstraction layer that standardizes interactions with various MCP servers.

- **[Agent Design and Optimization](./AGENT_DESIGN_AND_OPTIMIZATION.md)**:

  - In-depth information on the design of AI agents within TripSage. This covers the integration with the OpenAI Agents SDK, the hierarchical agent structure, tool design, handoff mechanisms, guardrails, and strategies for optimizing agent performance and token usage.

- **[Deployment Strategy](./DEPLOYMENT_STRATEGY.md)**:
  - Comprehensive plans for deploying TripSage across different environments (development, staging, production). This includes containerization strategies (Docker), CI/CD pipeline implementation (GitHub Actions), Kubernetes configuration, database deployment, and disaster recovery plans.

## Purpose

The documents in this section are intended to:

- Provide a clear understanding of how TripSage is built and how its components function together.
- Guide developers in adhering to established architectural patterns and design principles.
- Offer insights into the rationale behind key architectural decisions.
- Serve as a reference for maintaining and evolving the system's architecture.

Understanding these documents is crucial for anyone involved in the development, deployment, or maintenance of the TripSage platform.
