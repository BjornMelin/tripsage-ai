# Project Overview and Planning

This section provides a high-level view of the TripSage AI Travel Planning System's development lifecycle, current status, and future roadmap. It is intended for project managers, team leads, and developers looking to understand the overall project direction and progress.

## Contents

- **[Implementation Plan and Status](./IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_AND_STATUS.md)**:

  - The central document detailing the project's implementation plan, including completed tasks, ongoing work, and future priorities. It integrates the original `tripsage_implementation_plan.md`, `tripsage_todo_list.md`, `implementation_status.md`, and relevant parts of `required_changes.md`. This is the primary resource for tracking project progress and understanding the development roadmap.

- **[Cleanup Report](./CLEANUP_REPORT.md)**:
  - A summary of significant codebase cleanup efforts, such as the refactoring of the old `src/` directory. This document provides context on major structural changes and migrations.

## Purpose

The documents in this section aim to:

- Provide a clear and up-to-date overview of the project's goals and deliverables.
- Track progress against the defined implementation plan.
- Communicate key decisions regarding refactoring and architectural changes.
- Serve as a reference for understanding the project's history and evolution.

Please refer to the `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_AND_STATUS.md` for the most detailed and current information on project tasks and their completion status.
