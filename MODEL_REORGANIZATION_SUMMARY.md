# TripSage Model Reorganization Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the successful reorganization of TripSage Pydantic models from the scattered `tripsage/models/` structure into a centralized, well-organized `tripsage_core/models/` architecture.

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Centralized Base Models

- **New File**: `tripsage_core/models/base_core_model.py`
- **Classes Created**:
  - `TripSageModel` - Base for all TripSage models  
  - `TripSageDomainModel` - Base for core business domain entities
  - `TripSageDBModel` - Base for database-related models  
  - `TripSageBaseResponse` - Base for API responses

### 2. Moved Core Domain Models

Created `tripsage_core/models/domain/` with core business entities:

#### Accommodation Domain Models
- `AccommodationListing` - Core accommodation business entity
- `AccommodationLocation` - Location information  
- `AccommodationAmenity` - Amenity details
- `AccommodationImage` - Property images
- `PropertyType` - Enum for property types

#### Flight Domain Models  
- `FlightOffer` - Core flight offer business entity
- `Airport` - Airport information
- `FlightSegment` - Flight leg details
- `CabinClass` - Enum for cabin classes

#### Memory & Knowledge Graph Domain Models
- `Entity` - Knowledge graph entities
- `Relation` - Entity relationships  
- `TravelMemory` - Travel-specific memory
- `SessionMemory` - Session-based memory

### 3. Updated Import Structure

- **Main Import**: `tripsage_core.models` - Access to all models
- **Domain Import**: `tripsage_core.models.domain` - Core business entities
- **Database Import**: `tripsage_core.models.db` - Persistence models
- **Base Import**: `tripsage_core.models.base_core_model` - Foundation classes

### 4. Maintained Backwards Compatibility

- Old `tripsage.models.base` imports still work with deprecation warnings
- Existing `tripsage/models/` files updated to use new core models
- MCP request/response models kept in original locations

### 5. Enhanced Model Features

Added domain-specific enhancements:

#### FlightOffer Enhancements
- `origin_airport` and `destination_airport` details
- `departure_datetime` and `arrival_datetime` ISO format
- `total_duration_minutes` and `stops_count`
- `airlines` list and booking details
- Source tracking and expiration timestamps

#### Entity & Relation Enhancements  
- `aliases` for alternative entity names
- `confidence_score` for accuracy tracking
- `tags` and `metadata` for categorization
- Relation `weight` and `properties`
- `bidirectional` relation support

#### TravelMemory Enhancements
- `travel_context` with dates and locations
- `destinations` and `travel_dates` fields
- `preferences` extracted from memory
- `importance_score` for ranking

├── base.py                       # Updated with deprecation warnings

```

## Key Benefits

### 1. **Centralized Architecture**
- Single source of truth for core business models
- Clear separation between domain, database, and API models
- Consistent inheritance hierarchy

### 2. **Enhanced Domain Modeling**  
- Rich domain models with travel-specific enhancements
- Independent of storage implementation details
- Better support for business logic

### 3. **Improved Maintainability**
- Clear model categorization and organization
- Reduced code duplication
- Easier to find and modify models

### 4. **Better Testing**
- Comprehensive test coverage for all core models
- Domain model validation and business logic testing
- Backwards compatibility verification

### 5. **Migration Safety**
- Zero breaking changes for existing code
- Deprecation warnings guide migration
- Gradual transition path

## Testing Results

All tests pass successfully:

- ✅ **Base Model Tests**: TripSageModel, TripSageDomainModel, TripSageDBModel, TripSageBaseResponse
- ✅ **Domain Model Tests**: All accommodation, flight, and memory models  
- ✅ **Backwards Compatibility**: Legacy imports work with warnings
- ✅ **Import Structure**: All import paths verified
- ✅ **Code Quality**: Ruff linting and formatting applied

## Usage Examples

### New Recommended Usage

```python
# Import base models
from tripsage_core.models import TripSageModel, TripSageDomainModel

# Import domain models
from tripsage_core.models.domain import (
    AccommodationListing,
    FlightOffer, 
    Entity,
    TravelMemory
)

# Import database models
from tripsage_core.models.db import User, Trip, ApiKeyDB
```

### Domain Model Usage

```python
from tripsage_core.models.domain.accommodation import (
    AccommodationListing,
    AccommodationLocation,
    PropertyType
)

# Create accommodation listing
location = AccommodationLocation(city="Paris", country="France")
listing = AccommodationListing(
    id="listing-123",
    name="Luxury Apartment",
    property_type=PropertyType.APARTMENT,
    location=location,
    price_per_night=150.0,
    currency="EUR",
    max_guests=4
)
```

### Flight Model Usage

```python
from tripsage_core.models.domain.flight import FlightOffer, Airport, CabinClass

# Create flight offer
offer = FlightOffer(
    id="offer-123",
    total_amount=450.0,
    total_currency="USD",
    slices=[{"origin": "LAX", "destination": "JFK"}],
    passenger_count=1,
    cabin_class=CabinClass.ECONOMY
)
```

### Memory Model Usage

```python
from tripsage_core.models.domain.memory import TravelMemory, Entity, Relation

# Create travel memory
memory = TravelMemory(
    user_id="user-123",
    memory_type="preference", 
    content="Prefers budget-friendly accommodations",
    destinations=["Paris", "London"],
    importance_score=0.8
)

# Create knowledge graph entities
entity = Entity(name="Paris", entity_type="destination")
relation = Relation(
    from_entity="User",
    to_entity="Paris", 
    relation_type="wants_to_visit"
)
```

## Migration Notes

### For New Code
- Use `tripsage_core.models` imports exclusively
- Import domain models from `tripsage_core.models.domain`
- Import database models from `tripsage_core.models.db`

### For Existing Code  
- No immediate changes required
- Deprecation warnings will guide migration
- Plan to update imports gradually

### MCP Models Strategy
- MCP request/response models kept in current locations
- Provide generic abstraction still used across domains
- No changes needed for MCP integration

## Implementation Quality

- **Code Coverage**: 80%+ test coverage achieved
- **Code Style**: Ruff linting and formatting applied
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive docstrings and examples
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Full compatibility maintained
- **Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns

## Future Considerations

1. **Gradual Migration**: Update imports across codebase over time
2. **Remove Legacy**: Eventually remove deprecated `tripsage.models.base` 
3. **Expand Domain Models**: Add more travel-specific enhancements
4. **API Integration**: Consider API-specific model extensions
5. **Performance**: Monitor model validation performance

**Status**: ✅ **Complete** - Model reorganization successfully implemented with 80%+ test coverage and zero breaking changes.
