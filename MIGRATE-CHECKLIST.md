## Files to Investigate Further

Before deleting these files, we need to:

1. Compare content between `src/agents/accommodations.py` and `tripsage/agents/accommodation.py`
2. Check if `src/cache/redis_cache.py` functionality is fully covered by `tripsage/utils/cache.py`
3. Verify `src/api/dependencies.py` vs `tripsage/api/dependencies.py` differences
4. Compare utility files for overlapping functionality
5. Determine if test files in `src/tests/` should be migrated

## Next Steps

1. Use file comparison tools to check content differences
2. Identify any unique functionality in src/ that needs preservation
3. Create migration scripts for database-related code if needed
4. Update import statements in remaining src/ files
5. Gradually delete confirmed duplicate files

## Summary of Key Findings

### Files Already Deleted

1. **Agent Files**: All agent files that were renamed (e.g., accommodation_agent.py → accommodation.py)
2. **destination_research.py**: Different implementation with ResearchTopicResult class

### Major Architectural Differences

1. **MCP Integration**:

   - src/mcp/: Old MCP client implementations
   - tripsage/mcp_abstraction/: New abstraction layer with wrappers
   - tripsage/clients/: Refactored MCP client implementations

2. **Storage Strategy**:

   - src/utils/dual_storage.py: Direct TripStorageService implementation
   - tripsage/storage/dual_storage.py: Generic DualStorage class

3. **Error Handling**:

   - src/utils/error_handling.py: Basic error classes
   - tripsage/utils/error_handling.py: Enhanced with MCPError and decorators

4. **API Dependencies**:

   - src/api/dependencies.py: Database repository focused
   - tripsage/api/dependencies.py: MCP manager focused

5. **Cache Implementation**:
   - src/cache/redis_cache.py: Direct Redis implementation
   - tripsage/utils/cache.py: Advanced caching with content types and TTL

### Files Requiring Further Investigation

1. **src/agents/accommodations.py**: Contains AccommodationSearchTool class - determine if functionality is covered by new agent
2. **src/api/**: Entire API directory not migrated - check if needed
3. **src/db/**: Database implementation - may be replaced by MCP abstraction
4. **src/tests/**: Test files - need to determine migration strategy

## Migration Progress

- [x] Agents directory (complete - all files migrated or deleted)
- [ ] API directory (not migrated - decision needed on FastAPI implementation)
- [x] Cache directory (complete - functionality migrated to web_cache and Redis MCP)
- [x] Database directory (complete - all functionality migrated to MCP-based approach)
- [x] MCP directory (complete - refactored to mcp_abstraction and clients)
- [x] Utils directory (complete - all files migrated to enhanced implementations)
- [x] Tests directory (complete - old tests removed, new tests created)
- [x] Types directory (preserved - TypeScript types still useful)

## Recommended Actions

1. ✅ **Completed**: Deleted all duplicate files after verification
2. ✅ **Completed**: Old agents and tools removed after migration
3. ✅ **Completed**: Database layer fully migrated to MCP approach
4. ✅ **Completed**: Test cleanup and migration complete

## Final Status

The migration and cleanup is now complete. The only remaining item in `src/` is:

- `src/types/supabase.ts` - TypeScript type definitions (preserved as still useful)

### Next Steps

1. Decide on API implementation - whether to migrate `src/api/` or create new in `tripsage/api/`
2. Update import statements in any remaining code that references old `src/` paths
3. Consider moving TypeScript types to a more appropriate location if needed
