-- Security: Tests to identify potential RLS bypasses and vulnerabilities

-- ===========================
-- COMMON RLS VULNERABILITY TESTS
-- ===========================

-- Test 1: NULL user_id bypass attempt
-- Vulnerability: Some RLS policies fail when user_id is NULL
SELECT 'Testing NULL user_id bypass' AS test_name;

-- This should return no rows (auth.uid() should never be NULL for authenticated users)
-- But we test to ensure policies handle edge cases properly
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) 
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM trips WHERE user_id IS NULL;

-- Test 2: Performance under subquery policies
-- Vulnerability: Subquery policies can be slow and may leak timing information
SELECT 'Testing subquery policy performance' AS test_name;

-- Test performance of collaborative access
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) 
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM flights WHERE trip_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM trips WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    UNION
    SELECT tc.trip_id FROM trip_collaborators tc WHERE tc.user_id = auth.uid()
);

-- Test 3: Function injection through UNION
-- Vulnerability: UNION clauses in RLS policies can sometimes be exploited
SELECT 'Testing UNION clause security' AS test_name;

-- This should be prevented by RLS but we verify
-- Attempt to access flights through collaboration table manipulation
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)
SELECT f.* FROM flights f 
WHERE f.trip_id IN (
    SELECT trip_id FROM trip_collaborators 
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
);

-- Test 4: Cross-table reference validation
-- Vulnerability: RLS policies may not properly validate cross-table references
SELECT 'Testing cross-table reference validation' AS test_name;

-- Test that accommodations properly inherit trip permissions
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)
SELECT a.* FROM accommodations a
JOIN trips t ON a.trip_id = t.id
WHERE t.user_id = auth.uid();

-- Test 5: Memory table isolation
-- Vulnerability: Memory tables must have strict user isolation
SELECT 'Testing memory table isolation' AS test_name;

-- This should only return current user's memories
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM memories WHERE user_id = auth.uid();

-- Test 6: Session memories isolation
-- Vulnerability: Session memories must be properly isolated
SELECT 'Testing session memory isolation' AS test_name;

EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM session_memories WHERE user_id = auth.uid();

-- Test 7: API key isolation
-- Vulnerability: API keys must be strictly isolated per user
SELECT 'Testing API key isolation' AS test_name;

EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM api_keys WHERE user_id = auth.uid();

-- Test 8: Chat system collaborative access
-- Vulnerability: Chat messages should only be accessible through proper session hierarchy
SELECT 'Testing chat system access control' AS test_name;

EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)
SELECT cm.* FROM chat_messages cm
JOIN chat_sessions cs ON cm.session_id = cs.id
WHERE cs.user_id = auth.uid()
OR cs.trip_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM trips WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    UNION
    SELECT trip_id FROM trip_collaborators WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
);

-- ===========================
-- PERFORMANCE AND TIMING TESTS
-- ===========================

-- Test 9: Timing attack prevention
-- Vulnerability: Different response times might leak information
SELECT 'Testing timing attack prevention' AS test_name;

-- Time multiple identical queries to check for timing variations
\timing on

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM trips WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM trips WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM trips WHERE user_id = auth.uid();

\timing off

-- Test 10: Policy index effectiveness
-- Vulnerability: Missing indexes can cause performance issues and timing leaks
SELECT 'Testing policy index effectiveness' AS test_name;

-- Check if indexes are being used effectively
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)
SELECT t.* FROM trips t
LEFT JOIN trip_collaborators tc ON t.id = tc.trip_id
WHERE t.user_id = auth.uid() OR tc.user_id = auth.uid();

-- ===========================
-- ERROR HANDLING TESTS
-- ===========================

-- Test 11: Error message information leakage
-- Vulnerability: Error messages might reveal information about data existence
SELECT 'Testing error message leakage' AS test_name;

-- Try to access non-existent but valid-format UUIDs
SELECT * FROM trips WHERE id = 999999999;

-- Test 12: Boolean blind injection attempts
-- Vulnerability: Some RLS policies might be vulnerable to boolean-based attacks
SELECT 'Testing boolean blind injection resistance' AS test_name;

-- Test that policies are not vulnerable to boolean logic manipulation
SELECT EXISTS(
    SELECT 1 FROM trips WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND id > 0
) AS user_has_trips;

-- ===========================
-- COLLABORATION SECURITY TESTS  
-- ===========================

-- Test 13: Collaboration permission escalation
-- Vulnerability: Users might be able to escalate their collaboration permissions
SELECT 'Testing collaboration permission escalation' AS test_name;

-- Verify that view-only collaborators cannot perform edit operations
-- This should be enforced at the RLS policy level
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)
SELECT tc.* FROM trip_collaborators tc
WHERE tc.user_id = auth.uid() AND tc.permission_level IN ('edit', 'admin');

-- Test 14: Transitive collaboration access
-- Vulnerability: Users might gain access through transitive relationships
SELECT 'Testing transitive collaboration access' AS test_name;

-- Test that users cannot access data through secondary relationships
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)
SELECT f.* FROM flights f
WHERE f.trip_id IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT tc.trip_id FROM trip_collaborators tc
    WHERE tc.user_id = auth.uid()
);

-- ===========================
-- AUDIT AND MONITORING
-- ===========================

-- Test 15: Policy coverage verification
-- Vulnerability: Some tables might be missing RLS policies
SELECT 'Verifying RLS policy coverage' AS test_name;

-- Check that all user-data tables have RLS enabled
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    rowsecurity,
    CASE 
        WHEN rowsecurity THEN 'PROTECTED' 
        ELSE 'VULNERABLE'

    'configuration_profiles', 'configuration_versions', 'configuration_changes',
    'configuration_exports', 'configuration_performance_metrics'
)
ORDER BY security_status, tablename;

-- Test 16: Policy count verification
-- Vulnerability: Tables might have incomplete policy coverage
SELECT 'Verifying policy completeness' AS test_name;

SELECT 
    tablename,
    COUNT(*) as policy_count,
    string_agg(cmd, ', ') as operations_covered
