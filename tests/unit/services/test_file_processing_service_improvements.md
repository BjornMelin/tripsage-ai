# File Processing Service Test Improvements

## Overview

This document summarizes the modern pytest best practices applied to the `test_file_processing_service.py` test suite, following 2024 testing standards.

## Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. Modern Async Testing Patterns

- **pytest-mock Integration**: Replaced manual `AsyncMock` and `MagicMock` with pytest-mock's `mocker` fixture for cleaner and more maintainable mocking
- **Async Generators**: Implemented async file streaming with proper `AsyncGenerator` type hints
- **pytest-asyncio**: Added `pytest_asyncio` import for better async fixture support

### 2. Enhanced File Upload Testing

- **Realistic File Headers**: Added actual file format headers for better mime type testing:
  ```python
  SAMPLE_PDF_HEADER = b"%PDF-1.4\n%\xe2\xe3\xcf\xd3\n"
  SAMPLE_JPEG_HEADER = b"\xff\xd8\xff\xe0\x00\x10JFIF"
  SAMPLE_PNG_HEADER = b"\x89PNG\r\n\x1a\n"
  SAMPLE_ZIP_HEADER = b"PK\x03\x04"
  ```

- **io.BytesIO Usage**: Implemented file stream testing using `io.BytesIO` for realistic file handling
- **Multipart Form Simulation**: Added test for multipart/form-data uploads as received from web frameworks

### 3. Comprehensive Security Testing

Added dedicated `TestSecurityFeatures` class with tests for:

- **Path Traversal Prevention**: Tests for `../../etc/passwd` and similar patterns
- **Command Injection Prevention**: Tests for shell command injection attempts
- **Zip Bomb Detection**: Tests for files with suspicious compression ratios
- **Concurrent Upload Limits**: Tests for enforcing per-user upload limits
- **Malicious File Extensions**: Parametrized tests for various dangerous file types
- **Content Injection Prevention**: Tests for XSS, PHP, JSP, and ASP injection patterns

### 4. Parametrized Testing

Implemented extensive use of `@pytest.mark.parametrize` for efficient testing:

```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize("filename,expected_warnings", [
    ("../../etc/passwd", ["path traversal"]),
    ("..\\..\\windows\\system32\\config\\sam", ["path traversal"]),
    ("file\x00.txt", ["null byte"]),
    ("file;rm -rf /.txt", ["command injection"]),
    # ... more test cases
])
```

### 5. Advanced Mocking Patterns

Added `TestAdvancedMockingPatterns` class demonstrating:

- **mock_open Usage**: Proper file operation mocking with `mock_open`
- **Async Context Manager Mocking**: Testing async file operations with context managers
- **File Type Specific Processing**: Parametrized tests for different file processors

### 6. Performance Testing

Added `TestPerformanceOptimization` class with:

- **Large File Streaming**: Tests for memory-efficient streaming of large files
- **Memory Monitoring**: Tests with memory usage tracking using psutil mocks

### 7. Integration Testing Patterns

Added `TestIntegrationPatterns` class featuring:

- **End-to-End Testing**: Tests with minimal mocking for real service behavior
- **Webhook Integration**: Tests for async webhook notifications after file processing
- **Real Dependencies**: Fixtures that create services with actual dependencies

## Required Dependencies

To use all the modern features, ensure these packages are installed:

```bash
pip install pytest pytest-asyncio pytest-mock
```

## Best Practices Applied

1. **Consistent Fixture Usage**: All fixtures use the `mocker` parameter from pytest-mock
2. **Proper Async Testing**: All async tests properly use `@pytest.mark.asyncio`
3. **Meaningful Test Names**: Test names clearly describe what they're testing
4. **Comprehensive Error Testing**: Each error condition has specific match patterns
5. **Security-First Approach**: Security tests cover OWASP top vulnerabilities
6. **Real-World Scenarios**: Tests simulate actual usage patterns (multipart uploads, webhooks)

## Coverage Improvements

The enhanced test suite provides better coverage for:

- Edge cases in file validation
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance characteristics
- Integration points
- Error recovery scenarios

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/unit/services/test_file_processing_service.py -v

# Run only security tests
pytest tests/unit/services/test_file_processing_service.py::TestSecurityFeatures -v

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/unit/services/test_file_processing_service.py --cov=tripsage_core.services.business.file_processing_service
```

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:

1. **Property-based testing** with Hypothesis for edge case discovery
2. **Benchmark tests** with pytest-benchmark for performance regression detection
3. **Mutation testing** to verify test quality
4. **Contract testing** for API compatibility
