## Migration Considerations

When implementing V2.0 features:

1. **User Feedback First**: Only implement based on actual user demand
2. **Incremental Approach**: Add complexity gradually, not all at once
3. **Performance Impact**: Measure impact on core functionality
4. **Maintenance Cost**: Consider long-term maintenance burden
5. **Team Capability**: Ensure team can support additional complexity

## Decision Framework

Before moving items from V2.0 to main TODO:

- [ ] **User Demand**: Is there clear user demand for this feature?
- [ ] **ROI Analysis**: Does the value justify the complexity cost?
- [ ] **Core Stability**: Are core features stable and well-tested?
- [ ] **Team Capacity**: Does the team have bandwidth for additional complexity?
- [ ] **Technical Debt**: Is current technical debt manageable?

## Review Schedule

- **Quarterly**: Review V2.0 list for potential promotion to main TODO
- **Post-MVP**: Major review after MVP launch based on user feedback
- **Annual**: Comprehensive review of all V2.0 items for relevance

---

**Remember**: The goal is to deliver a robust, working MVP first. Complexity should be added judiciously based on real user needs, not anticipated requirements.
