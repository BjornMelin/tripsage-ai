  - **Migration Pattern:** Dual storage during transition, then full consolidation
  - **Memory System:** Integrated Mem0 with 91% performance improvement over custom implementation

- [x] **Knowledge Graph Integration** ✅ COMPLETED
  - **Architectural Decision:** Neo4j for relationship modeling, PostgreSQL for transactional data
  - **Reasoning:** Complementary strengths - graph queries vs. ACID transactions

  - **Architectural Decision:** PostgreSQL-based chat persistence with comprehensive audit trails
  - **Reasoning:** ACID compliance for chat history, built-in token estimation, automatic session expiration
  - **Security Approach:** Content sanitization, rate limiting, audit logging for compliance

- [x] **Distributed Caching Strategy** ✅ COMPLETED - PR #97
  - **Architectural Decision:** Redis MCP with content-aware TTL management and distributed locking
  - **Reasoning:** Performance optimization through intelligent caching, batch operations, pipeline execution
  - **Key Innovation:** Content-aware decorators (@cached_daily, @cached_realtime) for different data volatility
