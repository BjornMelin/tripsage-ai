    current_state: Dict[str, Any]
    preferences: UserPreferences
    active_bookings: List[Booking]
    search_context: SearchContext

### MCP Orchestration Patterns
```python
# Parallel execution pattern
async def parallel_search(query: SearchQuery) -> CombinedResults:
    tasks = [
        mcp_manager.invoke("flights", "search", query.flight_params),
        mcp_manager.invoke("accommodations", "search", query.hotel_params),
        mcp_manager.invoke("weather", "forecast", query.destination)
    ]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
    return combine_results(results)

# Sequential workflow pattern
async def booking_workflow(booking_request: BookingRequest) -> BookingResult:
    # Step 1: Validate availability
    availability = await mcp_manager.invoke("flights", "check_availability", 
                                          booking_request.flight_details)
    
    # Step 2: Reserve seat
    if availability.available:
        reservation = await mcp_manager.invoke("flights", "reserve", 
                                             booking_request.flight_details)
    
    # Step 3: Process payment
    payment_result = await mcp_manager.invoke("payments", "process", 
                                            booking_request.payment_info)
    
    return BookingResult(reservation=reservation, payment=payment_result)
```

### Session State Management
```python
class SessionState(BaseModel):
    session_id: str
    user_id: str
    current_agent: str
    agent_stack: List[str]  # For nested handoffs
    conversation_context: ConversationContext
    active_workflows: List[WorkflowState]
    cached_results: Dict[str, Any]
    created_at: datetime
    last_activity: datetime

# Session persistence with Redis MCP
async def save_session_state(session: SessionState):
    await mcp_manager.invoke(
        "redis", 
        "set",
        key=f"session:{session.session_id}",
        value=session.json(),
