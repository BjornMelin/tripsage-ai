# MCP Implementation Priority and Strategy

## Current Status (After Rollback)

✅ **CORRECTLY IMPLEMENTED:**

- Supabase MCP: External server integration (COMPLETED-TODO.md lines 455-478)
- Redis MCP: Caching and distributed operations
- Neo4j Memory MCP: Knowledge graph operations
- Duffel Flights MCP: Flight search integration
- Airbnb MCP: Accommodation search
- Google Maps MCP: Location services
- Weather MCP: Weather data integration
- Time MCP: Timezone operations
- Hybrid Web Crawling: Crawl4AI + Firecrawl with domain routing

❌ **ROLLED BACK (Over-engineered):**

- Custom FastMCP 2.0 Supabase server (violated "External First" strategy)

## Strategy Validation ✅

The **"External First"** strategy from GENERAL_MCP_IMPLEMENTATION_PATTERNS.md is correctly implemented:

1. ✅ External MCPs prioritized for standard functionality
2. ✅ Thin wrapper clients created for all MCPs
3. ✅ Custom MCPs only for core business logic (none needed yet)
4. ✅ Proper integration with MCP Abstraction Layer

## Next Priority Tasks (KISS Principle)

### 1. Google Calendar MCP Integration (Immediate)

**Target:** Complete remaining external MCP integrations
**Justification:** Calendar integration is essential for itinerary management
**Approach:** Use existing Google Calendar MCP server pattern

### 2. Enhanced Testing Framework (High Priority)

**Target:** Comprehensive MCP integration testing
**Justification:** Ensure reliability of external server dependencies
**Approach:** Create standardized test patterns for all MCPs

### 3. Performance Optimization (Medium Priority)

**Target:** Redis caching and parallel execution
**Justification:** Optimize response times across multiple MCP calls
**Approach:** Enhance existing Redis MCP integration

## Custom MCP Development Guidelines ⚠️

Only build custom MCPs when:

- ✅ Core to TripSage's unique business logic
- ✅ Direct database integration required
- ✅ Specific privacy/security requirements
- ✅ External MCPs cannot meet requirements

**Current Assessment:** No custom MCPs needed - external servers cover all requirements.

## Research Findings

From web search on Supabase MCP servers:

- **Official:** `@supabase/mcp-server-supabase@latest` (already configured)
- **Community:** Multiple implementations available
- **Best Practice:** Use official implementation when available
- **Architecture:** stdio transport with npx command (correctly implemented)

## Compliance with Documentation

✅ Follows GENERAL_MCP_IMPLEMENTATION_PATTERNS.md
✅ Aligns with COMPLETED-TODO.md status
✅ Implements KISS/DRY/YAGNI principles
✅ Uses external-first strategy
✅ Avoids over-engineering

## Recommendation

**Continue with Google Calendar MCP integration** as the next logical step, following the same external-first pattern successfully used for other MCPs.
