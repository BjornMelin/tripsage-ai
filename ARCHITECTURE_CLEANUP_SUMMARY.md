# Architecture Cleanup Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive cleanup performed to align the TripSage codebase with the new architecture documented in docs/REFACTOR/.

## Architectural Changes Implemented

### 1. MCP to Direct SDK Migration

- **Removed all MCP infrastructure** except for Airbnb (which lacks official API)
- **Deleted obsolete files:**
  - `/tripsage/utils/client_utils.py` - MCP client utilities
  - `/tripsage/config/mcp_settings.py` - MCP configuration
  - `/tripsage/clients/airbnb_mcp_client.py` - Created temporarily, then removed
  - All browser MCP infrastructure

### 2. Database Architecture Simplification

- **Removed Neo4j** - Deferred to V2, replaced with Mem0 + Supabase + PGVector
- **Deleted storage layer** - `/tripsage/storage/` directory (dual storage pattern no longer needed)
- **Updated database initialization** - Direct Supabase SDK usage
- **Refactored migration runner** - Uses direct Supabase client

### 3. Cache System Consolidation

- **Unified cache implementation** - Merged `cache.py` and `cache_tools.py`
- **DragonflyDB ready** - Cache module supports both Redis and DragonflyDB
- **Performance optimized** - Batch operations, pipeline support, distributed locks

### 4. Configuration Updates

- **Updated feature flags** - Removed references to deleted MCP services
- **Modernized env_example** - Aligned with new architecture:
  - DragonflyDB configuration
  - Mem0 memory system
  - LangGraph settings
  - Direct API integrations
  - Only Airbnb MCP remains
- **Cleaned service registry** - Removed MCP-specific abstractions

### 5. Utility Module Updates

- **Updated decorators** - Removed MCP/Neo4j references, added retry logic
- **Performance monitoring** - Created dedicated module for metrics
- **Session memory** - Already using Mem0 system (no changes needed)
- **Database utilities** - Clean, only references Supabase

## Files Modified

### Config Directory

- ✅ `feature_flags.py` - Removed deleted MCP services
- ✅ `service_registry.py` - Updated documentation, cleaned abstractions
- ✅ `env_example` - Complete rewrite for new architecture
- ✅ `app_settings.py` - Already updated with new architecture

### DB Directory

- ✅ `initialize.py` - Direct SDK connections
- ✅ `migrations/runner.py` - Direct Supabase SDK

### Utils Directory

- ✅ `cache.py` - Consolidated and modernized
- ✅ `decorators.py` - Removed MCP/Neo4j, added utilities
- ✅ `session_memory.py` - Already clean (Mem0-based)
- ✅ `db_utils.py` - Clean, Supabase-only

### Deleted Files

- ❌ `/tripsage/storage/` - Entire directory (dual storage obsolete)
- ❌ `/tripsage/utils/client_utils.py` - MCP utilities
- ❌ `/tripsage/utils/cache_tools.py` - Redundant cache module
- ❌ `/tripsage/config/mcp_settings.py` - MCP configuration

## Architecture Alignment

The cleanup ensures alignment with the REFACTOR specifications:

1. **LangGraph Integration** - Ready for graph-based orchestration
2. **Direct SDK Usage** - 11 of 12 services use direct integration
3. **Simplified Database** - Single source of truth with Supabase + PGVector
4. **High-Performance Cache** - DragonflyDB-ready with 25x performance gain
5. **Modern Memory System** - Mem0 for AI memory management
6. **Cost Optimized** - Eliminated expensive services and licensing

## Performance Improvements Expected

Based on REFACTOR documentation:

- **50-70% latency reduction** from direct SDK usage
- **25x cache performance** with DragonflyDB
- **11x vector search** improvement with PGVector
- **60% code reduction** from simplified architecture
- **$700-1200/year savings** from eliminated licenses

## Next Steps

1. **Update imports** - Ensure all modules use the new structure
2. **Run comprehensive tests** - Validate all changes
3. **Update documentation** - Reflect architectural changes
4. **Deploy to staging** - Test in production-like environment

## Notes

- Migration runner has limitations for raw SQL execution through Supabase client
- Consider using psycopg2 or Supabase Admin API for production migrations
- All new code follows Pydantic v2 patterns
- Feature flags enable gradual rollout of remaining changes
